## Why do DAO Interactions matter?

DAOs don't live in a bubble! They need to connect with other systems to work. These interactions are about:

* Making the DAO useful in the real world.
* Connecting with other digital tools.
* Keeping the DAO up-to-date.

## Key Aspects of DAO Interactions

* **On-chain Interactions:**
    * These are actions that happen directly on the blockchain.
    * **Smart contract executions:** The DAO's code doing its job.
    * **Governance proposals:** Voting and making changes on the blockchain.
    * **Treasury transactions:** Moving funds within the DAO.
    * This is the core of how the DAO operates.

* **Off-chain Interactions:**
    * These are actions that happen outside the blockchain.
    * **Community discussions:** Talking about ideas on forums or chat groups.
    * **Off-chain governance:** Using tools outside the blockchain for some decisions.
    * **Integrations with traditional systems:** Connecting the DAO to regular websites or services.
    * This is how the DAO interacts with the wider world.

* **Upgrades and Interoperability:**
    * DAOs need to change and grow.
    * **Upgrades:** Making the DAO's code better.
    * **Interoperability:** Making the DAO work with different blockchains and tools.
    * This ensures the DAO stays relevant and useful.
