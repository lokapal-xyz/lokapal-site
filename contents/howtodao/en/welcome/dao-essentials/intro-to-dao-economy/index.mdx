## Key Aspects of DAO Economy

* **DAO Treasury:**
    * This is the DAO's "bank account."
    * It involves budgeting and deciding how to spend money.
    * Good treasury management helps the DAO achieve its goals.

* **Tokenomics and Utility:**
    * Tokens are like digital shares in the DAO.
    * Tokenomics is about how these tokens work.
    * Utility means the tokens have a purpose, like voting or access to services.
    * Well-designed tokens encourage participation.

* **Revenue Streams and Value Distribution:**
    * How does the DAO make money?
    * How is that money shared among members?
    * This could involve fees, investments, or other income sources.
    * Fair distribution ensures everyone benefits from their contributions.
