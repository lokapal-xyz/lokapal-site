## Why does DAO Design matter?

Think of DAO design as the blueprint for a building. A good blueprint makes the building strong and useful. Similarly, a well-designed DAO:

* Makes sure everyone knows the DAO's purpose.
* Helps the DAO run smoothly and fairly.
* Protects the DAO from problems.

## Key Aspects of DAO Design

* **Defining DAO Objectives:**
    * What is the main goal of the DAO? (e.g., funding projects, managing software, investing)
    * What problems does it solve?
    * Having clear goals helps everyone stay focused.

* **Governance Architectures:**
    * How are decisions made? (e.g., voting with tokens)
    * Who gets to vote?
    * Can people delegate their votes to others?
    * This is about creating a fair way to make choices.

* **DAO Models:**
    * Different DAOs have different production needs. To meet those needs you can use:
        * **Industry Standards:** Using pre-made, widely-accepted and complete templates or frameworks.
        * **Utility Libraries:** Utilizing pre-built and separated code components or modules.
        * **Custom-Built DAOs:** Creating a DAO from the ground up, tailored to specific needs.

* **SubDAOs:**
    * Imagine a big company with smaller teams. SubDAOs are like those teams.
    * They let a large DAO break into smaller, specialized groups.
    * This helps the DAO handle more tasks and grow bigger.
