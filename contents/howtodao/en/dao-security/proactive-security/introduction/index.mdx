title: 'Proactive Security: Introduction'
description: DAO Security
---

Proactive security is essential for ensuring the resilience of a DAO against evolving threats. By identifying vulnerabilities early, anticipating governance risks, and setting up systems for monitoring, DAOs can effectively mitigate potential attacks before they escalate. 

This section covers the following key topics:

- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**  
  Smart contracts are a cornerstone of DAO functionality, but they can also be a target for malicious actors. This topic will explore common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks, front-running, and unauthorized access.

- **Identifying Governance Risks and Attack Vectors**  
  Governance is an attractive target for attackers seeking to control a DAO or manipulate its decision-making processes. Weâ€™ll look into how to identify risks related to governance models, voting mechanisms, and tokenomics, as well as the most common attack vectors that malicious actors might exploit.

- **Monitoring and Alerting Systems for DAO Security**  
  Continuous monitoring and the establishment of alerting systems are crucial for detecting potential security breaches in real time. This section will cover how DAOs can implement tools and systems for monitoring smart contracts, voting activities, and other critical processes, enabling them to respond swiftly to suspicious activities.

- **Off-chain Security Concerns**  
  While blockchain-based security is a core focus, DAOs must also consider off-chain security. This includes protecting communication channels, member data, and interactions with external systems, as well as securing governance tools that operate outside the blockchain.
