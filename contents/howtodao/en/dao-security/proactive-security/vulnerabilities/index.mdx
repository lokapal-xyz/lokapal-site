title: Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
description: DAO Security
---

Smart contracts form the backbone of DAOs, automating governance, treasury management, and decision-making. However, their immutable and permissionless nature makes them attractive targets for attackers. 

---

## Common Smart Contract Vulnerabilities  

- **Reentrancy Attacks**  
  - Occur when an external contract repeatedly calls a function before the original execution completes.  
  - Allows attackers to drain funds before balance updates occur.  
  - Prevention: Use Checks-Effects-Interactions, Reentrancy Guards, and pull-based payments.  

---

- **Front-Running & MEV Exploits**  
  - Malicious actors monitor the mempool and execute transactions before others.  
  - Can be used for sandwich attacks, arbitrage manipulation, or governance sniping.  
  - Prevention: Use commit-reveal schemes, time-locks, and private transaction relays (e.g., Flashbots Protect).  

---

- **Integer Overflows & Underflows**  
  - Occur when numbers exceed the maximum or minimum values, causing unintended behavior.  
  - Prevention: Use SafeMath libraries (integrated into Solidity 0.8+).  

---

- **Oracle Manipulation**  
  - If a DAO relies on a single price oracle, attackers can manipulate price feeds to drain treasuries or liquidate positions.  
  - Prevention: Use decentralized oracles (Chainlink, Pyth) and TWAP price feeds to mitigate manipulation.  

---

- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**  
  - Attackers can block contract execution, spam governance proposals, or prevent withdrawals.  
  - Prevention: Use gas limits, proposal thresholds, and rate-limiting mechanisms.  

---

- **Flash Loan Attacks**  
  - Involve borrowing large amounts of assets without collateral to manipulate markets.  
  - Allow attackers to exploit price disparities across DEXs or manipulate governance.  
  - Prevention: Implement time-weighted average prices, use multiple price oracles, and add transaction delays.

---

- **Access Control Flaws**  
  - Occur when critical functions lack proper authorization checks.  
  - Enable unauthorized users to execute privileged operations like fund withdrawals.  
  - Prevention: Implement comprehensive role-based access control, use modifiers consistently, and audit permissions.

---

- **Logic Errors & Incorrect State Management**  
  - Result from flawed business logic or improper state tracking.  
  - Lead to contract behaving differently than intended, often with financial consequences.  
  - Prevention: Thorough testing, formal verification, and clear documentation of state transitions.

---

- **Signature Replay Attacks**  
  - Involve reusing valid signatures to execute transactions multiple times.  
  - Allow attackers to repeat operations like withdrawals or approvals.  
  - Prevention: Include nonces, timestamps, or unique identifiers in signatures, maintain used signature tracking.

---

- **Block Gas Limit Issues**  
  - Occur when functions use loops with unbounded iterations.  
  - Can make functions impossible to execute when arrays grow too large.  
  - Prevention: Implement pagination, avoid unbounded loops, and design for gas efficiency.

---

- **Unchecked External Calls**  
  - Failures in external contract calls that aren't properly validated.  
  - Can lead to unexpected states when calls fail silently.  
  - Prevention: Check return values, use try/catch patterns, and implement proper failure handling.

---

- **Storage Collision**  
  - Occurs in proxy patterns when storage slots are accidentally overwritten.  
  - Results in data corruption and unpredictable behavior.  
  - Prevention: Use standardized storage patterns, careful upgrade planning, and storage gap variables.

---

- **Cross-Chain Bridge Vulnerabilities**  
  - Security flaws in cross-chain communication protocols.  
  - Enable theft of locked funds or unauthorized minting of wrapped tokens.  
  - Prevention: Multi-signature validation, robust consensus mechanisms, and rate limiting.

---

- **Timestamp Dependence**  
  - Occurs when contracts rely on block timestamps for critical operations.  
  - Miners can manipulate timestamps by several seconds, affecting time-sensitive logic.  
  - Prevention: Avoid precise timestamp dependencies, use block numbers for timing, and implement buffer periods.

---

- **Insecure Randomness**  
  - Results from using predictable on-chain data sources for generating random numbers.  
  - Allows miners or observers to predict or manipulate "random" outcomes.  
  - Prevention: Use commit-reveal schemes, verifiable random functions (VRFs), or oracle-provided randomness.

---

- **Lack of Input Validation**  
  - Occurs when contracts fail to properly validate external inputs.  
  - Enables manipulation through unexpected values, leading to logic flaws or overflows.  
  - Prevention: Implement comprehensive boundary checks, validate all inputs against expected ranges, and use require statements.

## Final Thoughts  

DAOs must proactively secure smart contracts to prevent catastrophic failures. Reentrancy, front-running, access control issues, and oracle exploits remain key threats. By following secure coding practices, implementing audits, and leveraging formal verification, DAOs can minimize vulnerabilities and maintain trust in their governance systems.
