title: Governance Recovery Mechanisms
description: DAO Security
---

A DAO’s governance system must be resilient enough to recover from security breaches, hostile takeovers, or malicious proposals. Without recovery mechanisms, a single attack could permanently destabilize governance or cause loss of treasury funds.  

---

## **Why Governance Recovery Is Critical**  

Governance vulnerabilities can be exploited in multiple ways:  
- **Malicious proposals** that drain the treasury or alter governance rules.  
- **51% attacks** where a hostile entity gains majority control.  
- **Stolen multisig keys** leading to unauthorized actions.  
- **Bribery or vote manipulation** that distorts decision-making.  

Without recovery mechanisms, DAOs may struggle to undo harmful actions or restore trust.

## **Rolling Back Harmful Proposals**  

DAOs must balance decentralization with security, ensuring malicious proposals can be reversed without allowing excessive centralization.  

### **Preemptive Safeguards**  
- **Time delays** on critical governance actions (e.g., 48-hour execution delay).  
- **Multi-step approval** for high-impact proposals.  
- **Community veto rights** to stop suspicious proposals before execution.  

### **Reversal Strategies**  
- **Emergency Veto Mechanisms**  
   - Allows governance multisigs or a security council to pause or cancel malicious proposals.  
   - Example: Compound’s GovernorBravo includes a “Guardian” role that can veto harmful changes.  

- **Proposal Reversal via Governance Vote**  
   - A DAO-wide vote to invalidate an executed proposal (if caught early).  
   - If this functionality is implemented, it must balance the risk of being used to reverse valid proposals.

- **Forking or Network Rollbacks**  
   - In extreme cases, DAOs may fork the protocol to create a new version without malicious changes.  
   - Example: The Ethereum Hard Fork after TheDAO hack (2016) restored stolen funds.

## **Regaining Control After a Governance Attack**  

If a DAO loses control to a malicious actor or compromised multisig, it must have protocol-level escape hatches to recover governance. The following are some key recovery strategies:  

### **Emergency Multisig Takeover**  
- If governance is compromised, a backup multisig can override harmful actions.  
- Requires trusted security signers with limited powers.  

### **Quorum and Voting Weight Adjustments**  
- Reducing voting power of suspicious wallets to prevent further attacks.  
- Temporary quorum changes to enable quick recovery actions.  
- Some DAOs allow for an emergency "snapshot vote" to adjust governance settings.  

### **Treasury Protection Mechanisms**  
- Multisig-controlled emergency withdrawals to move funds to a safe contract.  
- Time-locked withdrawals that allow recovery actions before assets are drained.

## **Post-Recovery: Strengthening Governance**  

After a security event, DAOs must review vulnerabilities and implement new protections to prevent future incidents.  

- **Post-Recovery Best Practices:**  
  - Conduct a post-mortem analysis to understand what went wrong.  
  - Strengthen multisig security and review keyholder permissions.  
  - Adjust governance frameworks to reduce attack risks.  
  - Consider protocol upgrades to add more security layers.
