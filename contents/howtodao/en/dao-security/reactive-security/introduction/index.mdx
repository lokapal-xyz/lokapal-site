title: 'Reactive Security: Introduction'
description: DAO Security
---

While proactive security measures are essential for preventing attacks, reactive security is equally important for responding effectively when breaches do occur. DAOs can adopt strategies to mitigate damage, recover from incidents, and learn from security events to strengthen future resilience.

This section covers the following key topics:

- **Developing Response Plans for Security Breaches**  
  A well-defined response plan is critical for managing and mitigating the impact of security breaches. This topic will explore how to develop and implement response plans that can be activated immediately when an incident occurs, ensuring that teams can respond quickly and minimize harm to the DAO.

- **Live Exploits and Safe Harbor Policies**  
  When a live exploit is discovered, it’s crucial to have policies in place to protect the DAO and its members. We’ll look into what constitutes a safe harbor policy—guidelines that offer protection and clarity during exploit incidents—and how to handle live exploits in a way that preserves the integrity of the DAO.

- **Governance Recovery Mechanisms**  
  DAO governance systems should include mechanisms for recovery after a breach. This section will cover strategies for rolling back harmful proposals, restoring control, and implementing mechanisms that allow DAOs to quickly regain operational control following an exploit or attack.

- **Post-Mortem Analysis**  
  After a security breach, conducting a thorough post-mortem analysis is essential for learning from the incident and improving future security. This topic will explore the importance of documenting the incident, analyzing its causes, and developing improved security protocols to prevent similar breaches in the future.
