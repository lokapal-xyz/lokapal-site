title: Live Exploits and Safe Harbor Policies
description: DAO Security
---

When a live exploit is in progress, rapid and strategic action is essential to minimize damage while maintaining the integrity of the DAO. However, responding recklessly can worsen the situation or drive away ethical hackers who might otherwise help. 

Safe harbor policies provide structured guidelines to handle exploits responsibly, ensuring cooperation between white-hat hackers, security teams, and DAO governance.

## **Understanding Live Exploits**  

**What is a Live Exploit?**  
  - Live exploit occurs when a vulnerability is actively being abused, allowing an attacker to steal funds, manipulate governance, or disrupt operations.  

**Challenges of Live Exploits:**  
  - Lack of real-time visibility—hard to determine the full extent of the attack.  
  - Panic and misinformation—leading to rash decisions.  
  - Difficulties distinguishing between white-hat and black-hat actors.  
  - On-chain immutability—most actions cannot be reversed.  

- **Goal:** Contain the damage while keeping governance functional and allowing ethical actors to assist.

## **What Are Safe Harbor Policies?**  

Safe Harbor Policies are predefined guidelines that protect ethical hackers (white hats) who intervene during an exploit to secure funds or prevent further damage.  

- **Why Safe Harbor Matters:**  
  - Encourages white-hat hackers to act without fear of prosecution.  
  - Provides legal clarity on how the DAO will handle exploit recovery efforts.  
  - Ensures a structured response, preventing chaos.  

- **Key Safe Harbor Guidelines:**  
  - White-hat actors must return funds (with a possible negotiated bounty).  
  - Clear reporting processes for security researchers to disclose findings.  
  - Governance-protected immunity for ethical hackers acting in DAO interests.

## **Handling Live Exploits in a DAO**  

### **Immediate Response Actions**  

- **Detect & Confirm the Exploit:**  
  - Use on-chain monitoring tools (Forta, Tenderly, OpenZeppelin Defender) to track attack vectors in real-time.  
  - Verify suspicious transactions and governance activities.  

- **Emergency Containment Measures:**  
  - Pause contracts (if possible) to stop further damage.  
  - Activate multisig emergency control to protect treasury assets.  
  - Warn the community (without exposing further vulnerabilities).

### **Differentiating Between White-Hats and Black-Hats**  

- **White-Hat Actors:**  
  - Extract and secure stolen funds to prevent further losses.  
  - Report vulnerabilities responsibly.  
  - Coordinate with DAO governance on fund recovery.  

- **Black-Hat Attackers:**  
  - Exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.  
  - Launder stolen assets through mixers or bridges.  
  - Refuse negotiations and ignore recovery efforts.  

- **How to Verify?**  
  - White hats communicate openly and return stolen assets voluntarily.  
  - Black hats try to obfuscate transactions and avoid engagement.

### **Governance & Legal Considerations**  

- DAOs must define clear legal frameworks for handling exploits.  
- Safe harbor agreements should be pre-approved by governance to avoid disputes.  
- Multi-jurisdictional DAOs must comply with global regulations on fund recovery and ethical hacking.

## **Best Practices for Managing Live Exploits**  

- Implement preemptive safe harbor policies to encourage ethical intervention.  
- Use real-time monitoring and alerting tools to detect exploits early.  
- Establish emergency governance protocols to prevent fund drains.  
- Create clear communication strategies to avoid panic.  
- Offer ethical incentives (bug bounties) to white-hat hackers.
