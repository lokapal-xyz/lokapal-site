title: 'Security Best Practices: Introduction'
description: DAO Security
---

Ensuring the security of DAO infrastructure is critical to protecting both the organization and its members. From smart contract development to key management and auditing, we find security practices that DAOs should adopt to minimize vulnerabilities and reduce risks.

This section covers the following key topics:

- **Secure Development Standards for DAO Contracts**  
  Developing secure smart contracts is the foundation of DAO security. This topic will cover best practices for writing secure code, including the importance of code audits, modular contract design, the use of established libraries (such as OpenZeppelin), and ensuring that contracts are resistant to common vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks, overflow errors, and unauthorized access.

- **Operational Best Practices**  
  Proper management of private keys and multisig setups is crucial for maintaining control and avoiding unauthorized access to DAO funds and governance mechanisms. This section will outline operational strategies for secure key management, how to implement robust multisig schemes, and how to ensure that voting mechanisms are resilient against manipulation and fraud.

- **Applied Security Research**  
  Ensuring the security of a DAO requires proactive measures such as audits, bug bounty programs, and responsible security disclosures. This section explores the importance of rigorous security assessments, incentivized vulnerability reporting, and transparent disclosure practices. By adopting these approaches, DAOs can mitigate risks, strengthen their smart contracts, and foster a more secure ecosystem for their participants.

- **Insider Threats**  
  Dangers to a DAO don’t always come from external attackers—sometimes, they originate from within. This section examines the risks posed by insiders, including administrators, developers, and trusted community members who may abuse their privileges for personal gain or sabotage the organization. 

- **Real-Life Dangers in DAO Operations**  
  While DAOs exist in the digital realm, the risks associated with managing and participating in them extend into the physical world. This section examines the real-world threats faced by DAO contributors, including targeted theft, extortion, kidnapping, and ransom scenarios. Additionally, we explore the legal risks associated with DAO involvement, including potential arrests and legal actions in jurisdictions with unclear or restrictive regulations.
