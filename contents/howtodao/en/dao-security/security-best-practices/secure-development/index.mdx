title: Secure Development Standards for DAO Contracts
description: DAO Security
---

Security is the foundation of trust in DAOs. Poorly written smart contracts can expose DAOs to exploits, governance attacks, and financial losses. Let's outline best practices for secure smart contract development, covering code audits, modular design, established libraries, and protection against common vulnerabilities.

## **Key Principles of Secure Smart Contract Development**  

### **Minimize Attack Surface**  
- Keep contracts as simple and modular as possible.  
- Reduce unnecessary on-chain complexity.  
- Avoid external contract calls unless absolutely necessary.  

### **Follow Established Security Patterns**  
- Use widely tested libraries (e.g., OpenZeppelin).  
- Implement access control with `Ownable` or role-based permissions (`AccessControl`).  
- Apply fail-safes like circuit breakers and emergency pausing mechanisms.  

### **Prioritize Upgradeability & Governance Security**  
- If using upgradeable contracts, ensure strict admin controls.  
- Document and restrict governance actions to prevent malicious upgrades.

## **Secure Development Practices**  

### **Use Well-Tested Frameworks & Libraries**  
- OpenZeppelin Contracts for governance, access control, and security utilities.  
- Foundry or Hardhat for advanced fuzz testing and security analysis.  

### **Implement Thorough Testing & Security Reviews**  
- Unit tests for individual contract functions.  
- Property-based testing for edge cases and unexpected inputs.  
- Fuzz testing to simulate randomized attack vectors.  

### **Modular & Upgradeable Contract Design**  
- Use proxy patterns (e.g., UUPS or Transparent Proxy) with restricted admin controls.  
- Ensure immutability when upgradeability is not needed.

## **Audit & Formal Verification**  

- **Internal Reviews**: Conduct peer reviews before deploying code.  
- **Third-Party Audits**: Use professional auditors for independent security reviews.  
- **Formal Verification**: Use Mathematical proofs (e.g., Certora, Echidna) for critical functions.

## **Security Best Practices for DAO Deployments**  

- Use Multisigs for Admin Controls (e.g., Gnosis Safe).  
- Implement Timelocks for major governance changes.  
- Monitor for suspicious activity (e.g., on-chain anomaly detection).  
- Have an Emergency Response Plan (e.g., bug bounties, white-hat disclosures).

## **Final Thoughts**  

Secure development is non-negotiable for DAOs. By following battle-tested security standards, leveraging audited libraries, and conducting rigorous testing, DAOs can mitigate vulnerabilities, prevent governance exploits, and build long-term resilience.
