The DAO treasury is one of the most crucial aspects of any decentralized organization. It represents the collective financial resources of the DAO, and its management directly impacts the sustainability and success of the organization. Proper treasury management ensures that funds are handled responsibly and in a way that aligns with the DAO’s long-term goals.
