title: Token Design, Supply Models, and Staking Mechanisms
description: DAO Economy
---

A well-structured token design is the backbone of a DAO’s economy, influencing governance, incentives, and long-term sustainability. The design choices—ranging from supply models to staking mechanisms—shape how tokens retain value, engage holders, and drive participation.

## Token Design Principles  

### The Role of Tokens in DAOs  
DAO tokens serve multiple functions beyond governance:  
- **Value Storage** – Represent a share of the ecosystem’s worth.  
- **Utility** – Grant access to features, rewards, and decision-making.  
- **Incentives** – Align participants’ interests with the DAO’s success.  
- **Security** – Prevent governance attacks by requiring economic commitment (e.g., staking).  

### Designing a Token for DAO Success  
Key factors in token design include:  
- **Scarcity & Supply Control** – Does the token have a fixed cap, or can more be minted?  
- **Utility Beyond Governance** – Is it just a voting token, or does it have additional use cases?  
- **Holder Incentives** – Are there staking rewards or participation benefits?  
- **Liquidity & Distribution** – How accessible is the token in markets?

## Token Supply Models  

### Fixed Supply Tokens  
- Total supply is set at launch. No new tokens are minted.  
- Encourages long-term holding due to scarcity.  
- Often used for governance tokens to prevent dilution.  
- **Risks:**  
    - Can lead to liquidity issues if too many tokens are locked.  
    - May encourage speculation instead of utility-driven use.  

---

### Inflationary Tokens  
- New tokens are continuously minted over time.  
- Helps fund development, staking rewards, and ecosystem growth.  
- Encourages continuous participation rather than hoarding.  
- **Risks:**  
    - Poorly managed inflation can devalue the token.  
    - Requires strong governance to prevent excessive supply growth.  

---

### Deflationary Tokens  
- Token supply decreases over time through burning mechanisms.  
- Creates artificial scarcity, boosting long-term value.  
- **Risks:** If deflation is too aggressive, it may discourage spending and participation.  

---

### Hybrid Models  
- Some DAOs combine inflation and deflation to balance incentives.  
- Examples include token buybacks, dynamic minting, and staking-based rewards.  

---

## Staking Mechanisms and Incentives  

Staking locks tokens into smart contracts, incentivizing holders to support governance, security, or network operations.  

### Governance Staking  
- Users stake tokens to vote on proposals.  
- Often used to prevent Sybil attacks (fake voter spam).  
- Some DAOs penalize inactivity by slashing voting power.  
- **Risks:** High staking requirements can create power centralization.  

---

### Economic Staking (Yield & Rewards)  
- Users lock tokens to earn yield, revenue shares, or protocol fees.  
- Encourages long-term holding and reduces sell pressure.  
- **Risks:** If rewards are too high, it can lead to unsustainable inflation.  

---

### Security Staking (Slashing-Based Models)  
- Stakers risk their funds if they act maliciously.  
- Common in validator-based networks like Ethereum.  
- **Risks:** Slashing penalties can discourage participation if too harsh.  

---

## Designing Staking Mechanisms for DAOs  

Effective staking design ensures fair rewards, participation incentives, and security.  

### Key Design Considerations  
- **Balance Rewards & Inflation** – Avoid excessive emissions that dilute value.  
- **Lock-Up Periods** – Time-based restrictions to prevent flash governance attacks.  
- **Slashing & Exit Penalties** – Prevent bad actors while ensuring fair participation.

## Final Thoughts  

The choice of token supply model and staking mechanisms shapes the long-term health of a DAO.  

- **Fixed supply tokens** promote scarcity but need liquidity solutions.  
- **Inflationary models** encourage growth but require governance oversight.  
- **Deflationary mechanisms** create long-term value but must avoid excessive hoarding.  
- **Staking** secures governance and rewards holders, but poor design can lead to centralization.
