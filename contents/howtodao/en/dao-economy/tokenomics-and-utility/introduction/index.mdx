title: 'Tokenomics and Utility: Introduction'
description: DAO Economy
---

Tokenomics plays a central role in the design and functionality of a DAO, as the structure and utility of its tokens influence participation, governance, and economic incentives. A well-thought-out token model can foster engagement, support sustainability, and align the interests of the DAO’s members.

This section covers essential topics related to tokenomics and utility in DAOs:

- **Token Design, Supply Models, and Staking Mechanisms**  
  Token design is foundational to a DAO’s economy. We’ll explore different token supply models, including inflationary, deflationary, and fixed supply designs. Additionally, we’ll dive into staking mechanisms, which incentivize token holders to engage in governance and ensure the security of the ecosystem.

- **Governance Token Utility Beyond Voting**  
  Governance tokens are often associated with voting power, but their utility can extend far beyond this. This section will discuss other uses of governance tokens, such as rewarding participation, accessing special services, or serving as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

- **Token Distribution Mechanisms**  
  Distributing tokens in a fair and strategic manner is key to aligning the interests of the community. This section will cover various token distribution methods, including fair launches, airdrops, and incentivized programs, with a focus on how to ensure fairness and encourage participation.
