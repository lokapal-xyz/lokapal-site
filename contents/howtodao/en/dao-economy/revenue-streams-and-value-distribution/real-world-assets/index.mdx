title: Integration with Real-World Assets
description: DAO Economy
---

DAOs are increasingly moving beyond purely digital ecosystems, engaging with physical assets, financial instruments, and real-world resources. Let's explore how DAOs can tokenize, manage, and govern real-world assets while addressing the legal, technical, and operational challenges involved.

## Why DAOs Are Integrating Real-World Assets  

While DAOs traditionally focus on on-chain governance and digital assets, real-world integration expands their capabilities in:  
- Tokenizing physical and financial assets (e.g., real estate, commodities, IP rights).  
- Managing physical property and infrastructure (e.g., community-owned land, renewable energy projects).  
- Interacting with TradFi and institutional investors (e.g., security tokens, RWAs in DeFi).  
- Bridging on-chain governance with off-chain decision-making (e.g., supply chain transparency).  

By integrating real-world assets (RWAs), DAOs can increase their impact, attract traditional investors, and expand governance into new domains.

## Tokenization of Real-World Assets  

### How Tokenization Works  
Tokenization converts real-world assets into blockchain-based representations, allowing DAOs to:  
- Fractionalize ownership → Lower entry barriers for investors.  
- Improve liquidity → Enable 24/7 trading of traditionally illiquid assets.  
- Automate governance → Use smart contracts for asset management and decision-making.

### Types of Tokenized Real-World Assets  

| **Asset Type** | **Examples** | **Use Cases for DAOs** |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Real Estate** | Tokenized property (e.g., Lofty, CityDAO) | Community-owned land, decentralized REITs. |
| **Commodities** | Gold, oil, carbon credits (e.g., Paxos Gold, KlimaDAO) | Sustainable finance, carbon offsetting. |
| **Intellectual Property** | Music royalties, patents, brands | IP rights governance, creator DAOs. |
| **Financial Assets** | Bonds, stocks, treasuries (e.g., MakerDAO RWA integration) | DeFi expansion into TradFi assets. |
| **Physical Infrastructure** | Renewable energy, water rights (e.g., EnergyWeb, Regen Network) | DAO-managed sustainability projects. |

DAOs can govern tokenized assets using smart contracts, decentralized treasuries, and governance frameworks.

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations  

### Legal Frameworks for Asset Ownership  
One challenge in tokenizing real-world assets is ensuring legal enforceability:  
- Some DAOs register as legal entities (e.g., Wyoming DAO LLCs) to hold physical assets.  
- Others rely on third-party custodians to ensure legal claim enforcement.  
- Hybrid models use real-world agreements plus smart contracts for ownership rights.  

### Jurisdictional Challenges  
- **Regulatory uncertainty** → Tokenized RWAs may be classified as securities in some regions.  
- **Property rights enforcement** → DAOs without legal status may struggle to enforce ownership claims in courts.  
- **Compliance with financial regulations** → KYC/AML requirements can create friction for fully decentralized models.  

- **Solution**: Emerging frameworks like Regulatory-Compliant Security Tokens (e.g., Securitize, Polymath) aim to bridge traditional finance and tokenized assets.

## Governance and Asset Management  

### Treasury and Custody Models  
DAOs managing RWAs must decide who holds legal and technical control over assets:  

| **Governance Model** | **How It Works** | **Examples** |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Fully On-Chain DAO** | Assets are controlled via smart contracts. | MakerDAO’s real-world collateral vaults. |
| **Hybrid DAO-Legal Entity** | A legally registered entity manages assets on behalf of the DAO. | CityDAO’s Wyoming DAO LLC. |
| **Custodian-Based Model** | Third-party custodians ensure legal asset holding and compliance. | Tokenized bonds, real estate investment DAOs. |

Smart contract-based treasury management ensures decentralization, but legal ownership may still require off-chain enforcement.

## Bridging On-Chain and Off-Chain Worlds  

To fully integrate RWAs, DAOs need robust mechanisms to connect blockchain governance with real-world operations:  
- **Oracles** (e.g., Chainlink, Pyth) → Verify off-chain asset data on-chain.  
- **Legal agreements + Smart Contracts** → Automate legal compliance through blockchain-based governance.  
- **Multi-sig & Decentralized Custody** → Ensure secure asset management.  

- **Future Vision:** Over time, legal frameworks may evolve to allow fully on-chain governance of real-world assets, reducing the reliance on traditional intermediaries.
