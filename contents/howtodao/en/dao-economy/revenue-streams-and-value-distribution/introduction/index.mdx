---

A sustainable economic model is essential for the longevity and success of a DAO. Generating consistent revenue and distributing value fairly across stakeholders ensures that the DAO can maintain its operations, incentivize participation, and fund its projects. 

This section explores the following key topics:

- **Sustainable Funding Models for DAOs**  
  Funding is crucial for any DAO’s operations and growth. We’ll explore different ways DAOs can secure funding, from community contributions to venture capital and beyond. We’ll also discuss how to balance short-term funding needs with long-term sustainability.

- **Integration with Real-World Assets**  
  DAOs are increasingly engaging with the real-world economy, such as tokenizing assets or managing physical property. This topic will examine the ways DAOs can interact with real-world assets, including legal frameworks, asset management, and establishing connections between blockchain-based assets and off-chain resources.

- **DAO Contributor Compensation Models**  
  Contributors play an integral role in the success of a DAO, and providing fair compensation is essential for attracting and retaining talent. We’ll explore different compensation models, including token rewards, salaries, and performance-based incentives, to ensure that contributors are properly incentivized.
