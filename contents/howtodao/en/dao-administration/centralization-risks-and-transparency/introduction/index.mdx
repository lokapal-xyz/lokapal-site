title: 'Centralization Risks and Transparency: Introduction'
description: DAO Administration
---

Decentralization is a core tenet of DAOs, but even the most well-intentioned DAOs can inadvertently fall into centralization. Identifying and mitigating these risks is essential for maintaining the integrity and democratic nature of the DAO. Additionally, transparency in governance structures ensures that all participants can trust the system and its decision-making processes.

This section covers the critical topics of centralization risks and transparency in DAO administration:

- **Identifying Centralization Risks in Governance**  
  Centralization can manifest in various ways, from concentrated voting power to an overreliance on a few individuals or entities for key decisions. We’ll explore how to identify these risks and the potential impact they can have on your DAO’s health and decentralization goals.

- **Transparency in Admin Privileges, Treasury Controls, and Voting Power Distribution**  
  Transparency is key to preventing the accumulation of unchecked power in the hands of a few. This section will examine how to maintain transparency in admin privileges, treasury management, and the distribution of voting power, ensuring fairness and accountability at all levels of the DAO.

- **Strategies for Progressive Decentralization**  
  In some cases, DAOs begin with more centralized structures for efficiency and then progressively decentralize over time. We’ll discuss strategies for transitioning toward greater decentralization while maintaining operational stability and security.
