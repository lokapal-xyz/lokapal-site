title: Assigning, Managing, and Revoking Administrative Permissions
description: DAO Administration
---

Ensuring secure and efficient management of administrative roles is critical for maintaining a DAO’s integrity. This section explores:  

- **Role Assignment** – Defining and distributing permissions.  
- **Permission Management** – Monitoring and adjusting access as needed.  
- **Revocation Mechanisms** – Safeguarding against misuse and minimizing risks.

## Assigning Administrative Roles  

DAO governance structures often require different levels of administrative control to manage protocol operations, treasury decisions, and governance execution.  

### Common Role Types  
- **Governance Admins** – Oversee smart contract upgrades and critical settings.  
- **Treasury Managers** – Handle fund allocation and financial operations.  
- **Proposal Executors** – Execute successful governance votes.  

### Best Practices for Role Assignment  
- **Least privilege principle** – Assign only the minimum permissions needed.  
- **Time-based roles** – Use temporary admin privileges where possible.  
- **Multi-layer verification** – Require on-chain voting or multi-sig approvals for critical roles.  

### Example: OpenZeppelin AccessControl  
- The AccessControl module allows role-based permissions with granular assignment.  
- Roles can be restricted, delegated, or revoked through governance votes.

## Managing Permissions and Security Considerations  

Once assigned, permissions should be monitored and updated as the DAO evolves. Mismanaged roles can lead to security breaches, governance attacks, or misaligned incentives.  

### Ongoing Role Management Strategies  
- **Periodic role audits** – Regularly review admin roles and their necessity.  
- **On-chain transparency** – Use smart contracts to track role changes.  
- **Multi-sig governance** – Require collective approval for administrative changes.  

### Case Study: The Tornado Cash Governance Attack  
- In 2023, an attacker gained control of governance contracts by exploiting admin permissions.  
- A lack of revocation mechanisms and multi-layer security enabled the takeover.

## Revoking Access and Handling Role Expiration  

Revoking permissions is just as important as granting them. Outdated, compromised, or inactive admins should be removed promptly to minimize security risks.  

### Methods for Revoking Permissions  
- **On-chain revocation** – Directly remove roles via governance votes.  
- **Time-locked permissions** – Set expiration dates for critical admin roles.  
- **Multi-sig intervention** – Require a group consensus before executing revocations.  

### Emergency Revocation Mechanisms  
- **Guardian Contracts** – Emergency addresses that can override permissions.  
- **Fail-safe Admins** – Pre-approved accounts that can remove malicious actors.  

### Example: Aragon’s Role Management System  
- Aragon DAOs use modular permissions to enable dynamic role adjustments.  
- Admins can be granted or revoked via DAO proposals.

## Final Thoughts  

A DAO’s security heavily depends on who controls administrative permissions. By implementing robust assignment, monitoring, and revocation mechanisms, DAOs can prevent governance exploits, insider risks, and operational failures.
