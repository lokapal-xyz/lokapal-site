title: Mitigating Risks of Key Compromises
description: DAO Administration
---

A compromised key can jeopardize DAO funds, governance, and operations. Let's explore strategies to minimize, detect, and recover from key-related security incidents.  

---

## Detecting Key Compromise Early  

### Best Practices  
- Enable real-time monitoring for unusual activity.  
- Set up alerts for large or unexpected transactions.  
- Use circuit breakers (e.g., transaction delays or withdrawal caps).  
- Conduct regular security audits of key management practices.  

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid  
- Ignoring small unauthorized transactions (potential test attacks).  
- Lack of on-chain analytics or monitoring tools.  
- Failing to review access logs and activity patterns.

## Recovery Strategies for Key Compromise  

### Best Practices  
- Implement emergency multisigs to override compromised keys.  
- Use time-locked transactions to allow rollback in case of an attack.  
- Have backup keys stored securely and separate from primary keys.  
- Utilize social recovery mechanisms for key restoration.  

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid  
- No contingency plan for lost or stolen keys.  
- Relying on a single recovery method (e.g., one backup keyholder).  
- Slow response time after detecting a compromise.

## Minimizing the Impact of a Compromised Key  

### Best Practices  
- Implement tiered access levels (limit high-privilege key usage).  
- Use keys that expire after a set period.  
- Set up modular governance to isolate risks (e.g., subDAOs with independent control).  
- Enable automated kill switches to revoke compromised permissions.  

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid  
- Granting all permissions to a single key or entity.  
- Failing to revoke access quickly after a compromise.  
- Using a rigid governance system that lacks emergency response flexibility.

## Final Thoughts  
- **Prevent** key compromise with secure storage and access control (see previous article).  
- **Detect** issues early with monitoring and alerts.  
- **Recover** quickly with backup multisigs and emergency procedures.  
- **Minimize** impact using tiered access and kill switches.
