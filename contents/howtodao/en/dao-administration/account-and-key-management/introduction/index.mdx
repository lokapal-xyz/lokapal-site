The security of accounts and keys is a cornerstone of a DAO’s integrity. Mismanagement of keys can lead to catastrophic security breaches, so understanding how to securely manage accounts and keys is crucial for maintaining the DAO's operations and trustworthiness.

This section covers the key aspects of account and key management:

- **Use of EOAs, Multisigs, and Smart Contract Wallets**  
  We’ll explore different types of wallets used in DAOs, including externally owned accounts (EOAs), multisig wallets, and smart contract wallets. Each has its own advantages and considerations for DAO administration, depending on the level of security and control required.

- **Security Practices for Key Management**  
  Effective key management practices are essential to prevent unauthorized access and attacks. This section will outline best practices for generating, storing, and distributing keys securely, as well as strategies for managing key backups and rotations.

- **Mitigating Risks of Key Compromises**  
  Key compromise can have severe consequences for a DAO, so it is essential to mitigate the risks associated with key theft or loss. We’ll discuss preventative measures, recovery strategies, and how to design systems that minimize the impact of key-related security incidents.
