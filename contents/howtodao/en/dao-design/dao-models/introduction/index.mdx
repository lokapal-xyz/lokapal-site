title: 'DAO Models: Introduction'
description: DAO Design
---

DAO models and frameworks provide the foundation for building decentralized governance systems. A variety of established frameworks, tooling, and libraries exist, offering flexibility and functionality depending on the needs of the project.

This section explores the different models and tools available for DAO design:

- **Industry Standards**  
  We’ll review widely adopted frameworks and platforms like Moloch, Compound Governor, Gnosis Safe Zodiac, Aragon, and Tally. These represent the backbone of many DAO implementations and provide time-tested solutions for governance and decision-making.

- **Utility Libraries**  
  We’ll look at utility libraries such as OpenZeppelin’s Governance and Access Control contracts, which offer pre-built, secure components for integrating governance features into your DAO architecture.

- **Custom-Built DAO Architectures and Novel Governance Models**  
  This section will cover custom-designed DAO architectures and emerging governance models that push the boundaries of traditional DAO frameworks. These offer unique features or solve new problems in decentralized governance.

- **No-Code and Low-Code DAO Creation Tools**  
  For those who want to build a DAO with minimal coding, we’ll explore no-code and low-code platforms that simplify the creation process. These tools are designed to empower individuals and communities to launch DAOs without extensive technical knowledge.
