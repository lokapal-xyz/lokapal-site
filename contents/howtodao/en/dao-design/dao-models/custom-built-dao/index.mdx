title: Custom-Built DAO Architectures and Novel Governance Models
description: DAO Design
---

While many DAOs rely on industry-standard frameworks, some projects push beyond conventional models by designing custom DAO architectures or experimenting with novel governance mechanisms. These approaches aim to enhance efficiency, decentralization, adaptability, and security, addressing governance challenges that traditional models may not solve.

## **Why Choose a Custom DAO Architecture?**  

While established DAO frameworks like Compound Governor, Moloch, and Aragon offer reliable, time-tested governance structures, they may not always fit a DAO’s unique needs. Projects often opt for custom-built architectures when they require:  

- **Tailored decision-making mechanisms** (e.g., non-token-based governance).  
- **Unique stakeholder structures** (e.g., multiple governance bodies with different voting powers).  
- **Hybrid governance models** that blend on-chain and off-chain participation.  
- **Scalability and modularity** beyond existing templates.  
- **New security models** that mitigate known governance risks.  

Custom architectures often incorporate bespoke smart contracts or modify existing governance frameworks to create flexible, project-specific solutions.

## **Emerging DAO Governance Models**  

The decentralized governance space is rapidly evolving. Here are some of the emerging models that are reshaping DAO architectures:  

### **Reputation-Based Governance**  
Instead of relying solely on token-weighted voting, some DAOs implement reputation-based systems, where governance power is based on contributions, expertise, or verified participation rather than token holdings.  

- **Example:** Gitcoin’s Quadratic Funding model, where voting power is amplified based on community support rather than raw capital.  
- **Advantage:** Reduces whale dominance and encourages merit-based participation.  
- **Challenge:** Requires reputation-tracking mechanisms, which can introduce subjectivity or manipulation risks.  

---

### **Multi-Tiered Governance (Council + Community Models)**  
Some DAOs combine community voting with a governance council or multi-sig committee to balance decentralization with efficiency.  

- **Example:** Nouns DAO operates fully on-chain but allows sub-DAOs to form specialized governance groups.  
- **Advantage:** Prevents governance gridlock while ensuring community oversight.  
- **Challenge:** Requires careful role definition and accountability to avoid centralization risks.  

---

### **Futarchy (Market-Driven Governance)**  
Futarchy is a governance model where markets decide policy. Instead of direct voting, members bet on which decisions will produce better outcomes, and policies tied to winning market predictions are enacted.  

- **Example:** Augur DAO leverages prediction markets to determine likely outcomes.  
- **Advantage:** Aligns governance with economic incentives and predictive accuracy.  
- **Challenge:** Susceptible to market manipulation and requires robust oracle systems.  

---

### **Conviction Voting (Continuous, Non-Binary Decision-Making)**  
Conviction voting allows members to gradually allocate influence over time instead of casting discrete "yes/no" votes.  

- **Example:** Giveth and Commons Stack use conviction voting to enable fluid governance.  
- **Advantage:** Long-term commitment matters more than short-term spikes in participation.
- **Challenge:** Requires sophisticated smart contract logic and can be hard to understand for newcomers.  

---

### **Quadratic and Sybil-Resistant Voting Mechanisms**  
Quadratic voting (QV) and other identity-based governance mechanisms aim to reduce plutocracy by preventing governance dominance by wealthy actors.  

- **Example:** Gitcoin Grants uses QV to allow broad community participation in funding decisions.  
- **Advantage:** Encourages wider voter participation and fairness.  
- **Challenge:** Requires Sybil resistance mechanisms, which can be complex.

## **Examples of Custom DAO Architectures**  

| **DAO Model** | **Project Example** | **Key Innovation** |
|--------------|:---------------:|----------------|
| **Modular DAO Design** | Gnosis Safe Zodiac | Enables governance add-ons via modular extensions. |
| **Hybrid Governance (Council + Token Holders)** | MakerDAO | Uses governance facilitators and delegates power to reduce inefficiency. |
| **Non-Token Governance (Reputation-Based)** | Coordinape | Allocates governance power based on peer voting and contributions. |
| **Futarchy** | Augur DAO | Prediction markets determine governance decisions. |
| **Quadratic Voting** | Gitcoin | Voting power is distributed equitably among smaller participants. |

## **Considerations When Designing a Custom DAO Architecture**  

| **Factor** | **Question to Consider** |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Complexity** | Will the added governance layers create usability challenges? |
| **Security** | Can governance mechanisms be exploited by governance attacks (e.g., 51% takeovers, bribery)? |
| **Scalability** | Can the governance model handle increasing member participation without bottlenecks? |
| **Adaptability** | Can the DAO modify governance rules if necessary? |
| **Fairness** | Does the governance model prevent whale dominance or Sybil attacks? |

---

## **Final Thoughts**  

While standardized DAO frameworks provide a strong foundation, many projects benefit from custom governance models that better align with their mission, security requirements, and decision-making philosophy.  

As DAOs continue to evolve, the key challenge remains finding the right balance between decentralization, security, and efficiency.
