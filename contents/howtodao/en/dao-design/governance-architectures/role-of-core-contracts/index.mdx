title: Role of Core Contracts, Access Managers, and Governance Extensions
description: DAO Design
---

In a well-structured DAO, smart contracts serve distinct roles to ensure security, flexibility, and maintainability. Instead of a single contract handling all governance logic, modern DAOs often separate responsibilities across core contracts, access managers, and governance extensions. This modular approach allows for better risk management, upgradability, and customization.

## **Core Contracts: The Foundation of a DAO**  

Core contracts form the backbone of a DAO, handling its most fundamental operations. These contracts often include:  

- **Treasury Management**: Governs how the DAO’s funds are stored, distributed, and allocated.  
- **Voting Mechanism**: Defines how proposals are created, voted on, and executed.  
- **Token Logic**: Manages governance tokens, including minting, burning, staking, and delegation.  

### **Key Considerations for Core Contracts:**  
- **Security and Immutability**: Since these contracts handle critical DAO functions, they are often designed to be immutable or upgradable via carefully controlled mechanisms.  
- **Minimalism**: Many DAOs keep core contracts as simple as possible to reduce attack surfaces and ensure longevity.  
- **Interoperability**: Core contracts should consider interaction with external services, such as off-chain voting tools or bridges for cross-chain governance.

## **Access Managers: Controlling Permissions**  

While a DAO aims for decentralization, not all actions should be permissionless. Access management systems help enforce who can execute critical functions and under what conditions.  

### **Common Access Control Models:**  

#### **Multisig-Based Control**  
- A multi-signature wallet (e.g., Gnosis Safe) is used to manage privileged actions, such as contract upgrades, treasury withdrawals, or parameter changes.  
- Used in early-stage DAOs to ensure security before full decentralization.  

#### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- Specific roles (e.g., Admin, Governor, Member) are assigned different privileges.  
- Helps DAOs delegate power without exposing critical functions to every member.  

#### **Timelocks for Safety**  
- Sensitive actions (e.g., contract upgrades, large fund transfers) are subject to a time delay before execution.  
- Allows community members to react to changes and prevent malicious actions.  

### **Key Considerations for Access Managers:**  
- **Balancing security with decentralization**: Too much restriction can lead to centralization, while too little can result in governance attacks.  
- **Progressive decentralization**: DAOs often start with strong access controls and transition to more decentralized mechanisms over time.

## **Governance Extensions: Enhancing DAO Functionality**  

Governance extensions introduce advanced decision-making mechanisms beyond simple token voting. These modular add-ons improve governance efficiency, fairness, and adaptability.  

### **Examples of Governance Extensions:**  

#### **Delegation Mechanisms**  
- Allows members to delegate votes to trusted representatives, improving participation without requiring constant voter engagement.  

#### **Quadratic Voting**  
- Weighs votes based on individual participation, reducing the influence of large token holders while amplifying community sentiment.  

#### **Proposal Filtering & Prioritization**  
- Uses reputation systems or staking mechanisms to prevent spam and highlight high-quality proposals.  

#### **Council or SubDAO Structures**  
- Certain governance tasks are delegated to elected or expert councils that operate under predefined constraints.  

### **Key Considerations for Governance Extensions:**  
- **Flexibility**: Extensions should be optional and adaptable to different governance models.  
- **Composability**: Well-designed extensions integrate smoothly with core contracts without adding unnecessary complexity.

## **Bringing It All Together: A Layered Approach**  

An effective DAO architecture distributes responsibilities across multiple layers:  

| **Layer** | **Function** | **Example Implementations** |
|--------|------------|----------------------|
| **Core Contracts** | Handles treasury, voting, and token logic | Gnosis Safe, Governor Bravo, Compound Governor |
| **Access Managers** | Controls permissions and execution power | OpenZeppelin AccessControl, Safe Modules |
| **Governance Extensions** | Enhances decision-making and efficiency | DAO councils, quadratic voting modules |

By separating governance into these components, DAOs reduce risk, increase flexibility, and enable long-term sustainability.

## **Final Thoughts**  

A DAO’s governance architecture should balance security, efficiency, and decentralization. Core contracts provide stability, access managers enforce necessary controls, and governance extensions allow for innovation and customization. By layering these components strategically, DAOs can evolve over time without sacrificing their core principles.
