title: 'Governance Architectures: Introduction'
description: DAO Design
---

The governance architecture of a DAO is a critical aspect of its functionality, defining how decisions are made, who has authority, and how those decisions are executed. The design of the underlying smart contracts plays a crucial role in shaping these governance mechanisms.

This section covers the key elements of DAO governance architecture:

- **Modular vs Monolithic Contract Design**  
  We’ll compare modular and monolithic contract structures, analyzing the benefits and trade-offs of each approach in terms of flexibility, maintainability, and security.

- **Role of Core Contracts, Access Managers, and Governance Extensions**  
  This section delves into the responsibilities of core contracts that manage essential DAO functions, the role of access managers in controlling permissions, and how governance extensions can enhance the functionality of a DAO.

- **External Plug-ins and Integrations**  
  We’ll discuss how external plug-ins and integrations with other protocols or tools can enhance the DAO’s governance, providing additional features or functionality.

- **Balancing Simplicity vs Complexity in Governance Mechanisms**  
  A critical design challenge in DAO governance is finding the right balance between simplicity (ease of use and adoption) and complexity (robustness and control). This section will help you navigate the trade-offs involved in designing an effective governance system.
