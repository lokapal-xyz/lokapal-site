SubDAOs provide a powerful way to scale governance and management within a larger DAO structure. By creating smaller, specialized governance entities under a parent DAO, subDAOs can increase efficiency, reduce complexity, and enable more focused decision-making.

This section explores the design and implementation of subDAOs:

- **SubDAOs Usage for Scaling Governance**  
  SubDAOs are often used to scale governance by delegating responsibilities to smaller, more manageable units. We’ll discuss scenarios where subDAOs are an ideal solution and how they can be structured to address specific needs within a larger organization.

- **Coordination Mechanisms Between Parent DAOs and SubDAOs**  
  Effective coordination between a parent DAO and its subDAOs is crucial for maintaining alignment and ensuring smooth operations. This section will explore mechanisms for communication, decision-making, and resource sharing between the parent and its subDAOs.

- **Use Cases: Treasury Management, Working Groups, and Local Governance**  
  SubDAOs can be leveraged in a variety of use cases, such as managing treasuries, organizing working groups, and implementing local governance for specific communities or regions. We’ll explore these use cases and how subDAOs can enhance the flexibility and effectiveness of DAO ecosystems.
