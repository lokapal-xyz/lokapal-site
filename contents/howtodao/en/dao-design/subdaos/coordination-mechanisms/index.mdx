title: Coordination Mechanisms Between Parent DAOs and SubDAOs
description: DAO Design
---

As DAOs scale through SubDAOs, maintaining alignment, efficiency, and governance coherence becomes a challenge. Without proper coordination, SubDAOs may become disconnected, leading to inefficiencies, conflicts, or even governance failures. Let's explore key coordination mechanisms between parent DAOs and their SubDAOs, focusing on communication, decision-making, and resource sharing.

## Why Coordination Matters  

While SubDAOs operate semi-autonomously, they still need to align with the parent DAO’s mission. Effective coordination ensures that:  

- Decisions remain aligned with the broader governance structure.  
- Resources (funding, data, contributors) are efficiently allocated.  
- Governance processes are clear and well-documented.  
- Disputes between the parent DAO and SubDAOs are resolved systematically.  

To achieve these goals, DAOs use various coordination mechanisms, which we’ll explore below.

## Governance Oversight and Delegation  

### Parent DAO as a Policy Maker  
- The parent DAO sets high-level policies and frameworks.  
- SubDAOs operate within these guidelines while retaining decision-making autonomy.  
- Smart contracts may automate enforcement of certain rules.  

### Delegated Voting and Veto Powers  
- Some DAOs delegate voting power to SubDAOs but retain veto rights over critical proposals.  
- This prevents misalignment while allowing SubDAOs to act independently.  
- Example: The parent DAO can override a SubDAO decision if it poses a security or governance risk.

## Communication Channels and Reporting  

### Regular Governance Updates  
- SubDAOs provide progress reports to the parent DAO via governance forums, Discord, or governance dashboards.  
- Transparency ensures alignment and accountability.  

### DAO-to-SubDAO Communication Platforms  
- DAOs often establish dedicated communication channels (e.g., Discourse, Notion).  
- Some DAOs implement on-chain message passing for secure, trustless communication.  

### Cross-DAO Representatives  
- Some SubDAOs elect representatives who regularly update the parent DAO.  
- These representatives serve as bridges between governance layers.

## Resource Allocation and Treasury Management  

### Funding Mechanisms  
- The parent DAO may fund SubDAOs through periodic grants or budget allocations.  
- SubDAOs must submit funding proposals outlining their objectives and expected outcomes.  

### Revenue Sharing Agreements  
- Some SubDAOs contribute a portion of their earnings back to the parent DAO.  
- This ensures sustainability and maintains a mutually beneficial relationship.  

### Emergency Fund Recovery  
- In cases of mismanagement or fraud, the parent DAO may reclaim funds or dissolve a SubDAO via governance votes.  
- Smart contract kill switches can enforce financial safeguards if needed.

## Conflict Resolution Mechanisms  

### On-Chain Arbitration  
- Some DAOs use arbitration protocols where disputes are resolved through tokenholder voting or decentralized courts.  

### Multi-Signature (Multisig) Safeguards  
- Shared multisig wallets allow joint oversight of funds and key decisions.  
- Example: A 3-of-5 multisig between parent DAO leaders and SubDAO representatives ensures checks and balances.  

### Escalation Procedures  
- Disputes may follow a structured escalation path, starting from internal discussions, then moving to community votes, and finally to arbitration or veto rights.

## Final Thoughts  

Effective coordination between parent DAOs and SubDAOs is essential for maintaining governance alignment, ensuring accountability, and optimizing resource allocation. By implementing clear delegation, communication structures, and conflict resolution frameworks, DAOs can scale efficiently while preserving decentralization.
