title: SubDAOs Usage for Scaling Governance
description: DAO Design
---

As DAOs grow in size and complexity, scaling governance becomes a challenge. Large communities often struggle with decision-making efficiency, contributor engagement, and operational management. One approach to solving these issues is the use of SubDAOs—smaller, semi-autonomous entities that operate within a larger DAO structure.

## **What Are SubDAOs?**  

A SubDAO is a governance structure that holds specific responsibilities as a smaller unit within a larger DAO. Instead of requiring all members to vote on every decision, a DAO can assign tasks, funding, or governance authority to SubDAOs that specialize in particular areas.  

SubDAOs can take various forms, such as:  

- **Treasury SubDAOs** – Managing fund allocations for grants, investments, or operational expenses.  
- **Working Group SubDAOs** – Handling specific functions like marketing, development, or partnerships.  
- **Regional or Local SubDAOs** – Overseeing governance in specific geographic areas or language-based communities.  
- **Project-Based SubDAOs** – Focused on temporary or ongoing initiatives, such as protocol upgrades or research.

## **How SubDAOs Help Scale Governance**  

### **Delegating Decision-Making**  
Instead of requiring thousands of DAO members to vote on minor operational details, SubDAOs make decisions independently while still adhering to the core DAO’s mission.  

### **Increasing Efficiency**  
A large DAO with too many governance proposals can lead to voter fatigue and slow decision-making. SubDAOs streamline governance by handling specific issues autonomously.  

### **Improving Expertise and Specialization**  
SubDAOs allow subject matter experts to focus on their domain without needing full DAO-wide approval for every action. This increases the overall quality and effectiveness of decision-making.  

### **Encouraging Contributor Engagement**  
When DAOs grow too large, individual members may feel disconnected. SubDAOs create smaller, engaged communities where members can participate more actively in governance.  

### **Enhancing Adaptability**  
A DAO with SubDAOs can quickly adapt to new challenges by allowing smaller units to experiment, iterate, and make localized decisions without waiting for a full DAO vote.

## **Potential Challenges and Considerations**  

While SubDAOs offer many benefits, they also introduce new governance challenges:  

- **Accountability** – How does the parent DAO ensure SubDAOs remain aligned with its overall goals?  
- **Autonomy vs. Oversight** – How much control should SubDAOs have over decision-making and treasury management?  
- **Coordination Complexity** – How do SubDAOs communicate and collaborate without creating governance silos?  
- **Security Risks** – How can DAOs prevent SubDAOs from being compromised or acting against the interests of the broader DAO?  

These considerations are crucial when designing effective SubDAO structures to ensure they strengthen rather than fragment governance.

## **Final Thoughts**  

SubDAOs are a powerful tool for scaling governance, improving efficiency, specialization, and contributor engagement. When structured effectively, they allow DAOs to delegate responsibilities, enhance decision-making, and remain agile in a rapidly evolving ecosystem.  

However, governance designers must carefully balance autonomy with oversight, ensuring that SubDAOs align with the broader DAO’s mission while maintaining efficiency and security.
