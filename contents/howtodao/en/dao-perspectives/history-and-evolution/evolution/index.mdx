title: Evolution of Governance Models Over Time
description: DAO Perspectives
---

DAO governance has progressed from simple token-based voting to multi-layered, adaptive models designed to address scalability, fairness, and decentralization. Let's explore the key phases of governance evolution, highlighting innovations such as quadratic voting, reputation-based models, and hybrid governance systems.

## **Early On-Chain Voting: Token-Weighted Models (2016-2018)**  

### **Token-Based Voting (1 Token = 1 Vote)**  
- Early DAOs (e.g., The DAO, Aragon) used pure token-weighted voting.  
- Holders with more tokens had more influence over decisions.  

**Advantages:**  
- Simple and transparent.  
- Fully on-chain and decentralized.  

**Issues:**  
- Plutocratic control – Wealthy holders dominated decisions.  
- Low participation – Many token holders were passive.  
- Voter apathy – Lack of engagement from smaller stakeholders.

## **Introduction of Delegated Governance (2019-2020)**  

### **Delegated Voting & Governance Token Models**  
- Inspired by liquid democracy, DAOs like MakerDAO, Compound, and Uniswap introduced governance token delegation.  
- Token holders could delegate votes to active community members (delegates).  

**Improvements:**  
- Increased participation through delegates.  
- Enabled expert-driven decision-making.  
- Reduced governance fatigue for passive holders.  

**Limitations:**  
- Still plutocratic (large holders could become dominant delegates).  
- Dependence on delegates’ engagement.

## **Reputation-Based and Quadratic Voting (2020-2021)**  

### **Reputation-Based Voting (Non-Transferable Influence)**  
- DAOs like Colony introduced reputation-based voting, where voting power is earned through contributions, not token holdings.  
- Reputation cannot be bought – only accrued through active participation.  

### **Quadratic Voting (Balancing Influence)**  
- DAOs like Gitcoin adopted quadratic voting, where voting power scales non-linearly.  
- The more votes a user casts, the more it costs, preventing wealth concentration.  

**Benefits:**  
- Reduces plutocracy (prevents large holders from dominating).  
- Encourages grassroots participation.  

**Challenges:**  
- Sybil resistance – Bad actors could create multiple accounts.  
- Requires identity verification (zk-proofs, soulbound tokens, or DID solutions).

## **Multi-Layered & Hybrid Governance Models (2021-Present)**  

### **Dual-Governance Systems**  
- Some DAOs combine token-based and reputation-based models.  
- **Example:** Optimism’s Citizens’ House & Token House  
  - Token House → Token-based governance for protocol decisions.  
  - Citizens’ House → Non-transferable voting rights for public goods funding.  

### **Council-Based & SubDAO Models**  
- DAOs now delegate power to elected councils or SubDAOs (e.g., Aave, Gnosis, ENS).  
- Elected councils make routine decisions while the wider DAO votes on critical issues.  

**Benefits:**  
- More efficient decision-making.  
- Balances decentralization with expertise.  
- Reduces voter fatigue.

## **The Future: AI, On-Chain Identity & Optimized Participation**  

### **AI-Assisted Governance**  
- AI-driven tools for governance analytics, summarization, and automated proposals.  

### **On-Chain Identity Solutions**  
- Soulbound tokens (SBTs) and decentralized identity (DID) to prevent Sybil attacks.  

### **Incentive-Driven Participation**  
- Rewarding active voters with governance incentives (but avoiding governance mining abuses).
