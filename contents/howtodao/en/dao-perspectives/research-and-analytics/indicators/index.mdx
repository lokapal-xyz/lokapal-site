title: Governance and Treasury Indicators
description: DAO Perspectives
---

Tracking governance participation is crucial for assessing a DAO's engagement, decentralization, and decision-making efficiency. A DAO's treasury health is critical for its long-term sustainability, operational efficiency, and governance stability. By analyzing these indicators, DAOs can identify governance weaknesses and optimize treasury management.

## Key Metrics for Governance Participation 

- **Essential Metrics:**  
  - **Voter Turnout Rate** – Percentage of eligible token holders who vote.  
  - **Proposal Submission Frequency** – How often new governance proposals are created.  
  - **Quorum Attainment Rate** – Percentage of proposals that reach the required quorum.  
  - **Delegation Ratios** – How many votes are cast via delegation vs. direct voting.  
  - **Repeat Participation** – Tracking whether the same members vote consistently.  

- **Example Benchmark:**  
  - Healthy DAOs often see 10-30% voter turnout, while lower participation may indicate voter fatigue or governance inefficiencies.

## Using Participation Metrics to Improve DAO Governance  

- **Data-Driven Governance Improvements:**  
  - Set participation goals based on historical data.  
  - Identify low-engagement areas (e.g., proposal categories with low turnout).  
  - Experiment with incentives (e.g., staking rewards for active voters).  
  - Use participation dashboards to visualize governance trends.  

- **Example Tools:**  
  - **DeepDAO** – DAO analytics platform tracking participation rates.  
  - **Boardroom** – Governance data aggregator.  
  - **Tally** – On-chain governance tool with voting analytics.

## Key Treasury Performance Metrics 

- **Essential Indicators:**  
  - **Total Treasury Value (TTV)** – Overall worth of DAO-controlled assets.  
  - **Asset Diversification Ratio** – Percentage breakdown across native tokens, stablecoins, and other assets.  
  - **Liquidity Reserves** – Availability of liquid assets for operations and emergencies.  
  - **Runway Estimation** – Number of months the DAO can sustain operations with current reserves.  
  - **Return on Treasury (RoT)** – Profitability of treasury investments.  

- **Example Benchmark:**  
  - A healthy DAO may target storing ~50% of assets in stablecoins to ensure liquidity and mitigate volatility risks.
