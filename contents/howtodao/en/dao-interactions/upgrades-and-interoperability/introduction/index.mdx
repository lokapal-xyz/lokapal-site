title: 'Upgrades and Interoperability: Introduction'
description: DAO Interactions
---

The governance and functionality of a DAO must evolve to stay relevant in a fast-paced, dynamic ecosystem. DAOs can adapt through smart contract upgrades, cross-chain governance models, and interoperability solutions.

This section covers the following key topics:

- **Managing Smart Contract Upgrades**  
  Upgrades to smart contracts are often necessary to improve security, add new features, or fix bugs. This section will examine how DAOs can manage these upgrades while maintaining transparency and minimizing disruptions, ensuring that the upgrade process is aligned with the communityâ€™s governance principles.

- **Ensuring Decentralized Control Over Updates**  
  Decentralization is a cornerstone of DAO philosophy, and ensuring that updates and upgrades to the DAO's infrastructure remain decentralized is critical. This topic will discuss the tools and strategies DAOs can use to maintain decentralized control over updates, such as multisig governance, upgradeable contracts, and community-driven processes.

- **Cross-chain Governance and Interoperability Solutions**  
  Many DAOs are moving toward cross-chain governance to ensure broader interoperability and to reach a more diverse ecosystem. This section will explore cross-chain governance models, including how DAOs can coordinate decision-making and governance across multiple blockchains, enhancing their reach and flexibility.
