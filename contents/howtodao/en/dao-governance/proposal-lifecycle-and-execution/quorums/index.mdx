title: Quorums, Voting Thresholds, and Execution Mechanics
description: DAO Governance
---

Ensuring that governance decisions reflect the will of the community requires well-defined quorums and voting thresholds. These parameters determine how many participants must be involved and what level of support is needed for a proposal to pass.

## Quorum Requirements  

### What is a Quorum?  
A quorum is the minimum level of participation required for a vote to be considered valid. Without a quorum, a small group of voters could pass proposals without broader community involvement.  

### Types of Quorums in DAOs  

- **Absolute Quorum** – A fixed minimum number of votes (e.g., 1,000 votes needed regardless of total voter participation).  
- **Relative Quorum** – A percentage of total token supply or governance power (e.g., 10% of circulating tokens must participate).  
- **Dynamic Quorum** – Adjusts based on factors like voter turnout or proposal type, reducing quorum requirements when participation is low.  

### Balancing Quorum Levels  

- **Too High →** Low participation may lead to governance stagnation.  
- **Too Low →** Small voter groups could manipulate decisions.  
- **Solution →** Dynamic or tiered quorum models ensure participation while maintaining security.

## Voting Thresholds  

### What is a Voting Threshold?  
A voting threshold is the percentage of votes required for a proposal to pass. It prevents minority rule and ensures decisions reflect majority support.  

### Common Voting Threshold Models  

- **Simple Majority (50%+1)** – The most common method, where a proposal passes if it gets more than half of the votes.  
- **Supermajority (e.g., 60%-75%)** – Used for high-impact proposals (e.g., protocol upgrades, treasury spending).  
- **Relative Majority** – The option with the highest votes wins, even if it’s below 50% (common in multi-choice voting).  
- **Quadratic or Weighted Voting** – Adjusts voting power based on participation to prevent dominance by large stakeholders.  

### Choosing the Right Threshold  

- **Lower thresholds (e.g., 50%)** encourage participation but risk controversial decisions passing too easily.  
- **Higher thresholds (e.g., 66%)** ensure consensus but can cause governance gridlock.  
- **Tiered models** allow different thresholds for different proposal types (e.g., lower for community initiatives, higher for constitutional changes).

## Proposal Execution Mechanics  

Once a proposal passes, it must be executed efficiently and securely. Execution can be:  

### Manual Execution (Off-Chain)  
- A trusted party (e.g., a multisig wallet or governance council) executes the approved changes.  
- Risks: Requires trust in executors; potential for delays or censorship.  

### Automated Execution (On-Chain)  
- Smart contracts execute the proposal once conditions are met.  
- Example: A passed proposal automatically triggers a treasury transfer.  
- Benefits: Reduces reliance on human intervention; improves transparency.  

### Hybrid Execution  
- A mix of on-chain and off-chain execution, where some decisions (e.g., funding approvals) occur on-chain while others (e.g., legal compliance) require off-chain action.

## Final Thoughts  

- Well-designed quorums prevent governance manipulation while encouraging participation.
- Appropriate voting thresholds balance efficiency with decision legitimacy.
- Execution mechanics determine how smoothly governance decisions are implemented.

Setting flexible, well-calibrated governance parameters ensures that DAOs remain efficient, resilient, and community-driven.
