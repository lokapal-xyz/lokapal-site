---

A structured proposal process is essential for effective DAO governance. A well-defined system ensures that ideas are thoroughly vetted, refined through community input, and aligned with the DAO’s objectives before being put to a vote.

---

## Proposal Submission  

Proposals are typically submitted by DAO members, core contributors, or governance delegates. The submission process varies by DAO but usually includes:  

- **Proposal Template** – A structured format that ensures clarity and completeness.  
- **Eligibility Criteria** – Requirements for who can submit proposals (e.g., minimum token holdings, governance role).  
- **Submission Platform** – Common platforms include on-chain forums, governance portals, and off-chain discussion boards.  

A standard proposal template often includes:  

- **Title** – A clear and concise name for the proposal.  
- **Summary** – A high-level overview of the proposal’s purpose.  
- **Motivation** – Why the proposal is necessary.  
- **Specification** – Detailed implementation plan, including technical and financial considerations.  
- **Risks and Mitigation** – Potential risks and how they will be addressed.  
- **Next Steps** – Actions required for implementation if approved.  

DAOs may require proposals to undergo an initial screening by governance stewards, moderators, or committees to ensure they meet basic submission criteria.

## Community Discussion and Feedback  

Once a proposal is submitted, it enters a discussion phase where the community can debate its merits, provide feedback, and suggest improvements.  

### Importance of Discussion  

- **Increases Proposal Quality** – Community feedback helps refine unclear or incomplete proposals.  
- **Builds Consensus** – Encourages early alignment, reducing opposition during voting.  
- **Identifies Unintended Consequences** – Spotting potential flaws before execution.  

### Common Discussion Channels  

- **Governance Forums** – Platforms like Discourse, Commonwealth, or dedicated DAO forums.  
- **Social Media & Chats** – Discussions on Discord, Telegram, or Twitter.  
- **Community Calls** – Live sessions where proposers present their ideas and answer questions.  

DAOs often set minimum discussion periods (e.g., 7–14 days) to ensure adequate review before moving to a vote.

## Proposal Refinement and Iteration  

Based on community feedback, a proposal may undergo revisions before proceeding to a formal vote. Refinement can involve:  

- Clarifying unclear sections based on community concerns.  
- Adjusting implementation details to align with feasibility constraints.  
- Modifying parameters such as budget allocations or governance structures.  
- Re-submitting the proposal if major changes require another round of discussion.  

Some DAOs use signal votes (non-binding votes) during the refinement stage to gauge community sentiment before a formal vote.

## Preparing for the Voting Phase  

Before moving to a vote, a proposal follows these steps:  

- **Final review:** to ensure it aligns with governance guidelines.  
- **Voting period assignment:** based on DAO governance rules.  
- **Vote announcement:** done through official DAO channels to maximize awareness and participation.  

Some DAOs require a proposal sponsor (e.g., a governance committee member or token holder with a threshold amount) to formally advance a proposal to voting.

## Final Thoughts  

- Proposal submission should follow a structured format to ensure clarity.
- Community discussion plays a critical role in refining and improving proposals. 
- Iteration and feedback help align proposals with the DAO’s goals before voting.
- Clear governance guidelines ensure transparency and participation in the proposal lifecycle.

A well-structured proposal process fosters better decision-making, higher engagement, and stronger governance legitimacy in DAOs.
