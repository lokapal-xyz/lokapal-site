title: 'Proposal Lifecycle and Execution: Introduction'
description: DAO Governance
---

The proposal lifecycle is a key process in DAO governance, defining how ideas are submitted, discussed, refined, and ultimately executed. From the initial submission to the final enforcement of decisions, understanding the full lifecycle ensures that proposals are handled in a transparent and efficient manner.

This section covers the critical stages of the proposal lifecycle:

- **Proposal Submission, Discussion, and Refinement**  
  We’ll explore the steps involved in submitting proposals, the importance of community discussion in refining ideas, and the mechanisms for incorporating feedback before moving to a vote. This ensures that proposals are well-considered and aligned with the community’s goals.

- **Quorums, Voting Thresholds, and Execution Mechanics**  
  Setting appropriate quorums and voting thresholds is crucial to ensure that proposals are supported by a sufficient portion of the community. We’ll discuss the mechanics of proposal execution and how these thresholds impact decision-making and governance effectiveness.

- **Automation and Enforcement of Governance Decisions**  
  Once a proposal is approved, automation can streamline the execution of decisions, reducing reliance on manual intervention. This section will cover how to automate the implementation of governance decisions and ensure that actions are enforced according to the proposal's terms.
