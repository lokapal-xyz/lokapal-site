title: On-Chain vs Off-Chain Voting
description: DAO Governance
---

Voting is a core governance mechanism for DAOs, determining everything from protocol upgrades to treasury management. However, DAOs must choose between on-chain and off-chain voting, each with its own trade-offs in terms of security, transparency, cost, and scalability.

## What Is On-Chain Voting?  

### How It Works  
- Votes are recorded directly on the blockchain as transactions.  
- Requires participants to sign transactions with their wallet.  
- The smart contract automatically enforces the outcome once voting ends.  

### Pros  
- Tamper-proof – Results are permanently stored on-chain, ensuring transparency.  
- Trustless execution – Smart contracts enforce decisions without intermediaries.  
- Immutable record – Prevents disputes over voting history or manipulation.  

### Cons  
- Expensive – Each vote requires a blockchain transaction, incurring gas fees.  
- Slow – Voting depends on network congestion and block times.  
- Lower participation – Users may avoid voting due to cost and technical barriers.  

### Best Use Cases  
- Critical governance decisions (e.g., treasury allocation, protocol upgrades).  
- When transparency and security outweigh cost concerns.  
- Mature DAOs with active, financially invested participants.

## What Is Off-Chain Voting?  

### How It Works  
- Votes are not recorded on the blockchain but instead conducted through external platforms (e.g., Snapshot, Discord polls, Google Forms).  
- Participants may sign messages cryptographically, but votes don’t require gas fees.  
- A separate execution mechanism (often multisigs) enforces results.  

### Pros  
- Gas-free voting – Encourages higher participation.  
- Faster – No need to wait for blockchain confirmation.  
- Flexible – Can allow for complex polling structures without smart contract limitations.  

### Cons  
- Not trustless – Results rely on external platforms or governance facilitators.  
- Potential for manipulation – Without on-chain enforcement, votes could be ignored or tampered.  
- Less transparency – Data integrity depends on the off-chain service provider.  

### Best Use Cases  
- DAOs prioritizing inclusivity and participation.  
- Early-stage DAOs testing governance models.  
- Non-binding signaling votes (e.g., gauging community sentiment).

## Comparing On-Chain and Off-Chain Voting  

| **Feature**        | **On-Chain Voting** | **Off-Chain Voting** |  
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|  
| **Security**      | High (immutable, trustless execution) | Medium (depends on platform integrity) |  
| **Transparency**  | Full (results visible on blockchain) | Partial (depends on external verification) |  
| **Cost**         | Expensive (gas fees for every vote) | Free or minimal (no gas costs) |  
| **Speed**        | Slower (blockchain confirmation time) | Faster (no transaction delays) |  
| **Scalability**  | Limited (high gas costs for large votes) | High (supports broad participation) |  
| **Flexibility**  | Low (rules must be pre-coded) | High (easy to adjust) |  

Both voting types have strengths and weaknesses. Many DAOs combine them to balance security and participation.

## Hybrid Approaches: Combining On-Chain and Off-Chain Voting  

Since neither system is perfect, many DAOs use hybrid governance models:  

### Example Approaches  
- **Off-Chain Signaling → On-Chain Execution**  
   - Step 1: DAO members vote off-chain (e.g., Snapshot).  
   - Step 2: If a proposal passes, a multisig or council executes it on-chain.  
   - Example: MakerDAO, Gitcoin Governance.  

- **Threshold-Based Hybrid Models**  
   - Small decisions (e.g., minor grants) are off-chain for speed.  
   - Major decisions (e.g., treasury withdrawals) require on-chain enforcement.  
   - Example: Optimism DAO, ENS governance.  

- **Vote Delegation**  
   - Participants vote off-chain but delegate final execution to trusted on-chain actors.  
   - Reduces on-chain costs while keeping a degree of trustless enforcement.

## Choosing the Right Approach for Your DAO  

- If security is the priority, use on-chain voting for key decisions.  
- If participation matters more, use off-chain voting to encourage engagement.  
- If balancing both, consider a hybrid model where off-chain votes guide on-chain execution.
