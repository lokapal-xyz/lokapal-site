title: Types of Voting Mechanisms
description: DAO Governance
---

Voting is the foundation of decentralized governance, allowing stakeholders to influence decisions, allocate resources, and shape the future of a DAO. However, different voting mechanisms have varying levels of fairness, security, and resistance to manipulation.  

---

## **Token-Based Voting**  

### **How It Works**  
- Each token represents one vote (1 token = 1 vote).  
- The more tokens a participant holds, the greater their voting power.  
- Used in most DAOs due to its simplicity and direct alignment with token ownership.  

### **Pros**  
- Simple and widely adopted – Easy to implement using ERC-20 governance tokens.  
- Aligned incentives – Token holders have a stake in the DAO’s success.  
- Efficient for high-stake decisions – Weighted voting reflects financial commitment.  

### **Cons**  
- Plutocratic risk – Large holders (whales) can dominate decisions.  
- Low voter participation – Holders may not engage in governance.  
- Vulnerable to vote buying – Tokens can be borrowed or delegated for influence.  

### **Best Use Cases**  
- Protocol governance (e.g., Uniswap, Compound).  
- DAOs where token ownership closely aligns with decision-making incentives.  

---

## **Quadratic Voting**  

### **How It Works**  
- Votes are not linear—the cost of casting multiple votes increases quadratically.  
- Prevents a single entity from dominating decisions with large holdings.  
- **Votes cost example:**
    - 1 vote costs 1 token
    - 2 votes cost 4 tokens (2²)
    - 3 votes cost 9 tokens (3²)
    - 4 votes cost 16 tokens (4²)
    - And so on...

### **Pros**  
- Balances influence – Large holders still have power but at diminishing returns.  
- Encourages diverse participation – Smaller stakeholders have a meaningful voice.  
- More democratic outcomes – Helps prevent whale dominance.  

### **Cons**  
- Requires identity verification – Without Sybil resistance, it can be gamed.  
- Complex implementation – Needs additional smart contracts and infrastructure.  
- Might not work well for all DAOs – If contributors have different levels of expertise, equalizing voting power may be counterproductive.  

### **Best Use Cases**  
- DAOs focused on community-driven governance.  
- Funding allocation (e.g., Gitcoin Grants).  
- Public goods funding where fairer representation is needed.

## **Conviction Voting**  

### **How It Works**  
- Voting power accumulates over time based on how long a participant supports a proposal.  
- Encourages long-term commitment rather than sudden voting spikes.  
- **Conviction formula example:**
  - Conviction = Prior Conviction × Decay Factor + New Stake

### **Pros**  
- Discourages short-term manipulation – Prevents last-minute whale votes.  
- Continuous governance – Members can express preferences dynamically.  
- Resistant to vote buying – Requires commitment over time, reducing flash influence.  

### **Cons**  
- Slow decision-making – Requires time for votes to accumulate influence.  
- New participants have less immediate power – Can disadvantage newcomers.  
- Might not be ideal for urgent decisions – Some DAOs need faster governance cycles.  

### **Best Use Cases**  
- Funding allocation decisions.  
- Community-driven DAOs with long-term incentives.  
- Ecosystems needing gradual consensus formation (e.g., Commons Stack).  

---

## **Holographic Consensus**  

### **How It Works**  
- A predictive market mechanism is used alongside traditional voting.  
- Participants stake tokens to signal which proposals deserve attention.  
- If a proposal passes a threshold of attention, it is fast-tracked for full DAO voting. 
- Just as a hologram recreates a 3D representation from a 2D medium, this voting mechanism attempts to project the will of the entire DAO through the actions of a smaller group. 

### **Pros**  
- Scalable governance – Prioritizes important proposals without overwhelming voters.  
- Filters out low-quality proposals – Prevents spam or unimportant governance items.  
- Efficient decision-making – Only high-impact decisions reach full DAO voting.  

### **Cons**  
- Requires staking participation – Low engagement can reduce efficiency.  
- Can be complex to understand – Requires educating DAO participants.  
- Depends on good economic incentives – Poorly designed incentives can lead to manipulation.  

### **Best Use Cases**  
- Large DAOs needing scalable governance (e.g., DAOstack).  
- DAOs where not every proposal should go to a full vote.  
- Projects using prediction-based governance models.

## **Delegated Voting (Liquid Democracy)**  

### **How It Works**  
- Participants delegate their voting power to trusted representatives.  
- Delegates can vote directly or pass delegation further.  
- Token holders can revoke or change delegation at any time.  

### **Pros**  
- Encourages expertise-driven governance – Delegates are often more informed.  
- Flexible – Participants can vote directly or delegate selectively.  
- Improves engagement – Low-effort way for passive members to participate.  

### **Cons**  
- Centralization risk – Delegation could lead to governance oligarchies.  
- Potential misalignment – Delegates may not always represent voter interests.  
- Requires trust in delegates – Governance could become too dependent on a few key figures.  

### **Best Use Cases**  
- DAOs with large, passive token holder bases (e.g., Compound, Aave).  
- Complex governance systems needing expert oversight.  
- Hybrid models combining direct and delegated voting.

## **Ranked-Choice Voting**  

### **How It Works**  
- Voters rank multiple options in order of preference.  
- If no option gets a majority, the lowest-ranked choice is eliminated, and votes are redistributed until a winner emerges.  
- **Ranked-Choice voting example:**

| **Candidate Option** | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** |
|-----------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| DeFi Yield Strategy   | 28%     | 30%     | 38%     | **52%** |
| NFT Project Investment| 15%     | 15%     | ~~X~~   | ~~X~~   |
| Protocol Improvement  | 22%     | 24%     | 28%     | ~~X~~   |
| Community Grants      | 25%     | 31%     | 34%     | 48%     |
| DAO Reserve           | 10%     | ~~X~~   | ~~X~~   | ~~X~~   |


### **Pros**  
- Encourages consensus-driven decision-making.  
- Reduces polarization – A broader range of opinions is considered.  
- Useful for selecting candidates or multi-option proposals.  

### **Cons**  
- More complex than single voting – Requires additional computation.  
- May not be ideal for binary decisions – Works better for multi-choice votes.  
- Potential for strategic voting – Voters may manipulate rankings.  

### **Best Use Cases**  
- Elections of DAO representatives or council members.  
- Decisions with multiple viable outcomes.  
- Situations where consensus-building is important.

| **Mechanism**        | **Best For** | **Main Trade-Off** |  
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------|  
| **Token-Based Voting** | Simple governance | Susceptible to whale dominance |
