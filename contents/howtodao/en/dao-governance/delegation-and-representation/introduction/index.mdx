title: 'Delegation and Representation: Introduction'
description: DAO Governance
---

In DAO governance, delegation and representation allow for more flexible decision-making, enabling participants to entrust their voting power to others. However, this introduces both opportunities and risks in terms of decentralization, accountability, and governance dynamics.

This section covers the key concepts of delegation and representation in DAOs:

- **Delegated Voting Models**  
  Delegated voting models, such as liquid democracy, allow participants to delegate their voting power to trusted representatives. We’ll explore different delegation systems, their mechanics, and how they can impact participation and decision-making within the DAO.

- **Representative Governance Structures**  
  Representative governance structures involve electing or appointing representatives who make decisions on behalf of others. We’ll discuss the benefits and challenges of using representative governance in DAOs, and how these systems can be structured to balance power and accountability.

- **Risks and Benefits of Delegation**  
  Delegation can increase efficiency and provide expertise, but it also carries risks such as centralization of power or lack of accountability. We’ll explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of delegation, and how to mitigate risks while maintaining decentralization.
