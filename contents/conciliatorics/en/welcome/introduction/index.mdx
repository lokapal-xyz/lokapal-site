## What is Conciliatorics?

*Conciliatorics* is a philosophical framework for thinking about systems—how they behave, how they change, and how we interact with them.

This project explores the dynamic between what is *interstitial* (emerging between things) and what is *intrinsic* (belonging to things themselves). It looks at how we shape systems and how systems shape us. Whether you're interested in philosophy, systems thinking, governance, or decentralization, the concepts here aim to offer useful tools for reflection and application.

You don't need a background in philosophy or systems theory to read this. Just curiosity, and maybe a bit of patience. You can visit the Glossary pages any time to review terminology and symbolic representations. 

## About the author

Conciliatorics is a personal research project by **Ricardo Pintos**. It draws from his experiences as a professional optician and physical therapist, his creative process as a musician and composer, and his analytical path as a philosopher and teacher. Each of these domains revealed clues about a deeper need for reconciliation between the intrinsic and the interstitial.

Sparse notes on this synthesis gradually evolved—first into isolated ideas, and eventually into an integrated framework. This journey is ongoing. Much refinement and research still lie ahead. The author remains committed to expanding these ideas and applying them to the development of decentralized systems.

## A Philosophical Framework for DAOs

As the foundation of Lokapal's work, *Conciliatorics* offers a theoretical basis for exploring decentralized governance. It serves as a guiding lens for DAO design, governance security, and systemic resilience.
