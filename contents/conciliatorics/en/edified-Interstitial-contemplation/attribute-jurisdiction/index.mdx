title: Attribute Jurisdiction
description: On tangled borders.

The last foundational concept we want to establish before opening the analytical gates is the idea that each attribute pair and their compounded interactions **must have clear boundaries**. To maintain awareness of these boundaries, we assign **jurisdictions** to each Conciliatorics element.

- **SYSTEMIC JURISDICTION**: The bounded environment that contains Conciliatorics components.

This concept retroactively enhances the terminology of previous chapters. For example, the four members of the Parcels Council each operate within their own *systemic jurisdiction*, whose boundaries are defined by the complementarity between their inventive approach and inventive position. We now extend this terminology to the components of Attributes Dynamics as well:

- **ATTRIBUTE JURISDICTION**: The bounded environment that contains Attributes Dynamics components.

The process of *inventive ossification* tends to erode these boundaries, as the proper scope of an inventive parcel begins to overreach into other jurisdictions.

- **JURISDICTIONAL OVERREACH**: The process by which one jurisdiction breaks boundaries to exert control over others.

But ossification and overreach are not the only systemic dynamics that can degrade jurisdictional clarity. Healthy jurisdictional boundaries must aim for proper **differentiation**. Boundary deterioration may also manifest through **dissociation** or **dissolution**.

- **JURISDICTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION**: The process and systemic state in which boundaries are maintained. The jurisdiction is aware of its distinct role while cultivating healthy interactionsâ€”this promotes **systemic diplomacy**.
- **JURISDICTIONAL DISSOCIATION**: The process and systemic state in which boundaries fracture. The jurisdiction isolates itself, forming a **systemic silo**.
- **JURISDICTIONAL DISSOLUTION**: The process and systemic state in which boundaries merge. The jurisdiction fuses into others, forming a **systemic amalgam**.

With our jurisdictional framework defined, we can now establish a clear starting point for exploring the next EIC concepts:

1. We begin with the **spatial** and **temporal** attribute pair.
2. The spatial attribute expands into the **stillness** and **movement** attribute pair.
3. The temporal attribute expands into the **successiveness** and **simultaneity** attribute pair.
4. These three attribute pairs are contained by the **primary jurisdiction**.

- **PRIMARY JURISDICTION**: The initial environment of attribute pairs within Attributes Dynamics.

With our primary jurisdiction in place, we can now expand our scope toward more complex EIC configurations. We can always trace back to these root concepts to verify the internal coherence of our exploration. And we must remember that our ultimate goal is to reach analytical synthesis. This journey is bounded by two guiding anchors: a theological anchor (Attributes Regulation) and a teleological anchor (Attributes Synthesis), ensuring we do not wander aimlessly through our Conciliatorics path.
