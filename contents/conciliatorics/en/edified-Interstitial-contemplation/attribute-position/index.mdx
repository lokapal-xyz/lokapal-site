title: Attribute Position
description: On taking sides.

Before expanding to complex systemic behaviors and structures, we need to know precisely what we are working with as our conceptual materials. Our inventive approach is clearly contemplative, but we need to be precise on how the inventive position is implemented. EIC aims its focus on the interstitial aspects of Behavior Dynamics, but when we approach concrete attributes, there is also a specific *attribute position* that must be identified.

- **ATTRIBUTE POSITION**: Focus of systemic attributes. The two main attribute positions are *intrinsic attributes* and *interstitial attributes*.

For EIC, we are going to maintain our focus on **interstitial attributes**. This marks a strong departure from traditional Philosophy, which usually approaches both intrinsic and interstitial aspects of our world. For example, Metaphysics tries to study what exists in Reality. But instead of improving craftsmanship, expanding artistry, or using the scientific method to extract useful information, it produces perspectives that—although often interesting—lack integration with the broader knowledge reservoir.

From our point of view, this is one of the main causes for ossification in philosophical frameworks. The other three inventive parcels usually have a clearer focus, but Philosophy tends to give itself license to analyze everything that feels appropriate. While this can create interesting perspectives, it tends to depart from the outcomes of other fields. The disconnection between current philosophical discussions and the broader culture has its roots in this unregulated scope.

This, of course, has a historical context. Philosophy in the West was originally conceived as the upper bound of knowledge, containing also what we categorize now as the sciences. Once the scientific method emancipated the sciences and took a predominant position in society and culture, Philosophy has struggled to define itself and its proper boundaries. With Conciliatorics, we offer an alternative to the current state that gives the philosophical instinct a specific home, without the need to compete with the other fields for relevance.

Before leaving, we are going to tie from the start *attribute position* with the last element of Attributes Dynamics. **Attribute Disposition** is the resulting outcome of the entire EIC journey. We are not going to develop this concept here, but we want to mention the connection so it is clear from the outset that our model wants to always tie back to its origin and also have a concrete way to interact holistically with the rest of Behavior Dynamics.

**Trajectory of Attributes Dynamics**

| **ATTRIBUTE POSITION (Beginning)** | **ATTRIBUTE DISPOSITION (End)** |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Intrinsic Attributes          | Centralization / Decentralization |
| Interstitial Attributes       | Unification / Conciliation |

We can now proceed to the fundamental mechanics through which attributes interact to form more complex expressions.
