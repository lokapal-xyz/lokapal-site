Let's examine how this integration is represented. Organic and instrumental synthesis share more similarities with each other than with mixed synthesis, and they are also simpler in structure. Therefore, we'll review them together. Remember that the complete interstitial anatomy set has this symbolic form:

- **Interstitial Anatomy**: `{iD ≡ iO ≡ iR ≡ iE}`

We can combine this set with any of the physiology types, and we could use different types of operators to do so. Anatomy and physiology have equal hierarchy, so we could connect them with the symmetry operator. Also, we already used concatenation to relate elements of distant origins, which will be fitting here. Although anatomy and physiology are both equal in systemic hierarchy and conceptually distant in nature, we feel that these two operators are not quite appropriate to express their interaction.

Interstitial anatomy explores sophisticated intricacies of systemic elements, but those structures are in essence **lifeless**. On the other hand, interstitial physiology is a strong force that animates deep qualities of a system, but those forces are essentially **formless**. To better illustrate their interaction according to these specific qualities, physiology should modulate anatomy. Therefore, we'll use the modulation operator.

- **Organic Synthesis**: `[I≢L → (I≡ ^ I≢)] → {iD ≡ iO ≡ iR ≡ iE}` = oS
- **Instrumental Synthesis**: `[C≡L → (C≡ ^ C≢)] → {iD ≡ iO ≡ iR ≡ iE}` = iS

However, to more precisely represent how synthesis manifests, we should specify which anatomical quadrant is being animated by which physiological longing. So, let's see how specific quadrants accentuations should fit in these synthesis.

- **Discernment**: `{iD ← (iO ≡ iR ≡ iE)}`
- **Organic Discernment**: `[I≢L → (I≡ ^ I≢)] → {iD ← (iO ≡ iR ≡ iE)}`
- **Observation**: `{iO ← (iD ≡ iR ≡ iE)}`
- **Instrumental Observation**: `[C≡L → (C≡ ^ C≢)] → {iO ← (iD ≡ iR ≡ iE)}`

As you can see, these symbolic representations are starting to be long and confusing. We can still use them, but there is also the possibility to simplify them:

- **Organic Discernment (Simplified Form)**: I≢L → iD
- **Instrumental Observation (Simplified Form)**: C≡L → iO

These shorter forms go straight to the point. And because elements like physiological longings (I≢L) and anatomical quadrants (iD) don't interact in other contexts, we won't get into symbolic conflicts by using them. We'll explore potential implementations of organic and instrumental synthesis at another time, since these simplified expressions are just the tip of the iceberg. Let's move on with the last synthesis form.
