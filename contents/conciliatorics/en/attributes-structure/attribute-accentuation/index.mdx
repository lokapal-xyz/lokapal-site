title: Attribute Accentuation
description: On heed and periphery.

Let's start this section by refreshing the Attributes Structure definition and introducing its components:

- **ATTRIBUTES STRUCTURE**: EIC step that explores the interstitial anatomy components of Behavior Dynamics.

As you can see, our goal is to build up the main concept of Attributes Structure: **Interstitial Anatomy**. But for that, we need additional concepts in order to reach that point. We'll develop new EIC concepts by implementing *attribute operators* to *attribute pairs*. Let's start by taking the attribute pairs of the primary jurisdiction and applying the **accentuation** operator.

| **ACCENTUATION** | **SYMBOLIC FORM** |
|----|---|
| Stillness ← Movement = Pro-Stillness | Q ← M = pQ |
| Movement ← Stillness = Pro-Movement | M ← Q = pM |
| Simultaneity ← Successiveness = Pro-Simultaneity | Si ← Su = pSi |
| Successiveness ← Simultaneity = Pro-Successiveness | Su ← Si = pSu |

The **Stillness-Movement** attribute pair begins in a state of symmetry: **Stillness ≡ Movement**. By temporarily focusing on one of the attributes we are not necessarily breaking the symmetry, as long as we don't dismiss the other side of the attribute pair. We use the accentuation operator to indicate this focus shift: **Stillness ← Movement**.

As we move toward more complex relationships, using the full attribute pair every time becomes impractical. So, we need a new term to signal this type of focus. But using an attribute term alone (e.g., "Stillness") can easily lead to forgetting its complement. We use for this purpose the "pro-" prefix: **Stillness ← Movement = Pro-Stillness**.

Using "pro-" allows us to start moving away from the symmetry state without breaking the attribute pair. In EIC, "pro" does not imply preference, and most certainly does not mean that we are against the other aspect of the attribute pair (e.g., "Anti-Movement"). The prefix is just used as a concise tool to build more concepts while maintaining our theological anchor (Attributes Regulation).

The symbolic representation `Q ← M = pQ` helps us to quickly visualize these interactions, and they'll become handy when reaching complex configurations. With our new set of concepts, we can progress to the next section, in which we'll start to bridge abstract concepts to practical methods.
