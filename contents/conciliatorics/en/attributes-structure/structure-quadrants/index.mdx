title: Structure Quadrants
description: On 1 + 1 = 11.

We have now **four new concepts** derived from the use of accentuation:
- Pro-Stillness `pQ`
- Pro-Movement `pM`
- Pro-Successiveness `pSu`
- Pro-Simultaneity `pSi`

It follows that we can create more concepts if we apply more attribute operators. But this time we'll use the **concatenation** operator to form another set of terms: the **Structure Quadrants**. Remember that we use concatenation to represent interactions between concepts that don't belong to attribute pairs (or to other types of tightly interconnected components).

You can think of concatenation like this: Element A is **IN THE PRESENCE OF** Element B. And just their joined presence creates a particular quality. For example: the word "No" just signals an abstract negation, and the word "Home" refers to a place of residence. But if you *concatenate* them you get "No home", which creates far more complex associations, like feeling that you can't call any place your home. In short, "abandonment".

| **STRUCTURE QUADRANTS** | **SYMBOLIC FORM** |
|----|---|
| Pro-Stillness ^ Pro-Successiveness = Discernibility | pQ ^ pSu = D |
| Pro-Movement ^ Pro-Successiveness = Observability | pM ^ pSu = O |
| Pro-Stillness ^ Pro-Simultaneity = Resolutivity | pQ ^ pSi = R |
| Pro-Movement ^ Pro-Simultaneity = Operativity | pM ^ pSi = E |

Now we can analyze these terms by their semantic meaning to bridge them for practical use.

### Discernibility

We can better *discern* aspects of Reality when a phenomenon is still. It's like watching a blue jay resting on our rooftop to examine its plumage. Then, years pass and we encounter the same bird. But now its plumage changed, so we explore the color shifts. Our ability to discern blue jays' plumage expanded by waiting for the bird to sit still, and be mindful of the years' succession.

From this analogy we can reinforce that, in our model, **Discernibility** is the intersection between **Stillness** and **Successiveness**. Its EIC equation is:

- Pro-Stillness ^ Pro-Successiveness = Discernibility

And the proper symbolic form for this quadrant is: `pQ ^ pSu = D`. For the following quadrants we can refer directly to the previous table.

### Observability

A sparrow tries to catch an insect mid-flight. We *observe* its movements as our clumsy friend keeps trying. Finally, the sparrow is successful. This hunting activity was only detected by witnessing the bird's constant attempts. And from these elements we infer that **Observability** is the intersection between **Successiveness** and **Movement**. 

### Resolutivity

In order to *resolve* an issue we must reach a resting state in which all relevant elements are considered simultaneously. Just like doves handle the threat of urban predators—they flock together and sit still on a wire. This reminds us that **Resolutivity** is the intersection between **Stillness** and **Simultaneity**.

### Operativity

Crows migrate during the winter to avoid the cold—they can't wait for the summer's return. A murder of crows must *operate* within the restrictions of the seasons and move together to a warmer setting. From this we can establish that **Operativity** is the intersection between **Simultaneity** and **Movement**.

Now that the four quadrants are set, we are ready to assemble one of the most relevant sections of EIC: **Interstitial Anatomy**. If the reader is confused by any of the subjects treated until this point, we suggest a revision of our journey until now, so we are solid before the next section.
