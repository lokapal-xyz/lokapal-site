The **structure quadrants** form a set similar to an attribute pair: `{D ≡ O ≡ R ≡ E}`. Each of these four components holds equal weight. Shifting focus to one requires maintaining awareness of its relationship with the other three. So, we can use the **accentuation** operator again—this time applied to the Structure Quadrants instead of attributes.

| **QUADRANT ACCENTUATION** | **SYMBOLIC FORM** |
|----|---|
| Accent on Discernibility = **Discernment** | `{D ← (O ≡ R ≡ E)}` = iD |
| Accent on Observability = **Observation** | `{O ← (D ≡ R ≡ E)}` = iO |
| Accent on Resolutivity = **Resolution** | `{R ← (D ≡ O ≡ E)}` = iR |
| Accent on Operativity = **Operation** | `{E ← (D ≡ O ≡ R)}` = iE |

These accentuations form a new set called **Interstitial Anatomy**: `{iD ≡ iO ≡ iR ≡ iE}`. We'll explain the meaning of this naming structure. 
- The ability to discern (Discernibility) is a **potential state**—one of four sides of an *abstract interstitial design* (Structure Quadrants). 
- A member discerning over a systemic element (Discernment) is a **concrete action**—performed by an agent with a *specific interstitial method* (Interstitial Anatomy). 

When implementing Conciliatorics analysis, the interstitial anatomy methods are more frequently used. So, it helps that the term assigned to the concrete action is shorter than its potential state counterpart.

While we are discussing these issues within the Conciliatorics context, we can simply use the term **discernment**. However, since this word has broader meanings in general conversation, we recommend using the more specific term **interstitial discernment** when working outside the Conciliatorics domain. Think of "interstitial" as a surname—within the family, “John” is enough, but outside, you might need to say “John Smith” to avoid confusion.

To recap:
- **Discernibility**: potential state. Component of Structure Quadrants: `{D ≡ O ≡ R ≡ E}`
- **Discernment**: concrete action. Component of Interstitial Anatomy: `{iD ≡ iO ≡ iR ≡ iE}`
- **Interstitial Discernment (iD)**: appropriate term outside Conciliatorics.

**NOTICE**: The same is true for the rest of the quadrants accentuations.

Now we can move forward with a detailed exploration of each element of Interstitial Anatomy.
