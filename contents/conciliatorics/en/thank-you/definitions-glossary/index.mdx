This is a curated list of core concepts, theoretical terms, and systemological language developed or redefined within *Conciliatorics*.

## Part 1: Introduction to Conciliatorics

- **META-DISCIPLINE**: A discipline (field of study) that deals with, or transcends, other disciplines.

- **SYSTEMICS**: A meta-discipline that groups different perspectives on the study of systems.

- **CONCILIATORICS**: A perspective within Systemics that seeks to reconcile the inventive aspect of Systemic Intervention.

---

- **BEHAVIOR DYNAMICS**: A model containing one main systemic phenomenon (**Behavior**) and three main systemic entities (**System**, **Member**, **Medium**).

- **BEHAVIOR**: The transformation of a medium by system members.

- **SYSTEM**: An environment where interrelated members express behavior.

- **MEMBER**: A unit that expresses behavior within a system.

- **MEDIUM**: Components of a system transformed by its members to express their behavior.

---

- **SYSTEMIC INTERVENTION**: Action performed by a member that seeks to influence the behavior of a system.

- **INTERVENER**: Member who intervenes in a system.

- **INVENTIVE SYSTEMIC INTERVENTION**: Exploration of a system's medium that seeks to influence its behavior.

---

- **INVENTIVE PARCELLATION**: Primary structure of inventive intervention.

- **INVENTIVE APPROACH**: Method of inventive intervention.

- **INVENTIVE POSITION**: Focus of inventive intervention.

- **CONTEMPLATION**: Inventive approach with emphasis on the *intervener*. Relates to *knowledge building* and *judgement*.

- **TRANSFORMATION**: Inventive approach with emphasis on the *system*. Relates to *concrete change* and *performance*.

- **INTRINSICALITY**: Inventive position with emphasis on the *intervenable*. Relates to *direct engagement* and *inherent properties*.

- **INTERSTITIALITY**: Inventive position with emphasis on the *systemic*. Relates to *intangible outcomes* and *relational properties*.

- **INVENTIVE PARCELS**: Main configurations of inventive parcellation: Intrinsic Contemplation, Intrinsic Transformation, Interstitial Contemplation and Interstitial Transformation.

---

- **INVENTIVE EDIFICATION**: Continuous and expansive development of inventive parcels.

- **INVENTIVE OSSIFICATION**: The manifestation of dysfunctional processes in inventive edification.

- **INVENTIVE CONCILIATION**: The restoration of functional processes in inventive edification.

- **PARCELS COUNCIL**: A structured method for facilitating conciliation.

---

## Part 2: Edified Interstitial Contemplation

- **ATTRIBUTE**: Specific quality of a system, member or a medium. In this framework, an attribute is not merely a passive trait but a dynamic component that interacts with behavior, structure, and purpose.

- **ATTRIBUTES DYNAMICS**: An EIC model designed to promote analytical exploration and integration of attributes.

- **ATTRIBUTES REGULATION**: EIC step that provides the rule set to explore the attributes structure and status.

- **ATTRIBUTES STRUCTURE**: EIC step that explores the interstitial anatomy components of Behavior Dynamics.

- **ATTRIBUTES STATUS**: EIC step that studies the interstitial physiology processes of Behavior Dynamics.

- **ATTRIBUTES SYNTHESIS**: EIC step that integrates the exploration of attributes structure and status.

---

- **ATTRIBUTE POSITION**: Focus of systemic attributes. The two main attributes positions are *intrinsic attributes* and *interstitial attributes*.

- **SYSTEMIC JURISDICTION**: The bounded environment that contains Conciliatorics components.

- **ATTRIBUTE JURISDICTION**: The bounded environment that contains Attributes Dynamics components.

- **JURISDICTIONAL OVERREACH**: The process by which one jurisdiction breaks boundaries to exert control over others.

- **JURISDICTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION**: The process and systemic state in which boundaries are maintained. The jurisdiction is aware of its distinct role while cultivating healthy interactions—this promotes **systemic diplomacy**.

- **JURISDICTIONAL DISSOCIATION**: The process and systemic state in which boundaries fracture. The jurisdiction isolates itself, forming a **systemic silo**.

- **JURISDICTIONAL DISSOLUTION**: The process and systemic state in which boundaries merge. The jurisdiction fuses into others, forming a **systemic amalgam**.

- **PRIMARY JURISDICTION**: The initial environment of attribute pairs within Attributes Dynamics.

---

## Part 3: Attributes Structure

- **ATTRIBUTE ACCENTUATION**: Temporary focus on one member of an attribute pair.

- **STRUCTURE QUADRANT**: Concatenation of two attribute accentuations, creating a potential interstitial state.

- **INTERSTITIAL ANATOMY**: Set of concrete interstitial actions, composed of structure quadrants accentuations.

| **ANATOMY TERMS** | **Potential State** | **Concrete Action** | **General Context Term** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **To Discern** | Discernibility | Discernment | Interstitial Discernment |
| **To Observe** | Observability | Observation | Interstitial Observation  |
| **To Resolve** | Resolutivity | Resolution | Interstitial Resolution  |
| **To Operate** | Operativity | Operation | Interstitial Operation  |

---

- **BOUNDED DISCERNMENT/OBSERVATION**: Quadrant depending on member's perspective.

- **NON-BOUNDED DISCERNMENT/OBSERVATION**: Quadrant detached from member's presence.

- **COMPASS**: Original name for Operation quadrant.

--- 

## Part 4: Attributes Status

- **ATTRIBUTE CONCATENATION**: Crossed interaction between attribute pairs from the primary jurisdiction.

- **STATUS DICHOTOMIES**: Concatenation between reinforcing and canceling attribute pairs.

- **INTERSTITIAL LONGING**: Survival and performance drive.

- **INTERSTITIAL PHYSIOLOGY**: Set of interactions between interstitial longings and status dichotomies.

---

- **ORGANIC PHYSIOLOGY**: Interaction between "perdurability longing" and "imperdurability / perdurability dichotomy".

- **INSTRUMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY**: Interaction between "functionality longing" and "functional / dysfunctional dichotomy".

- **MIXED PHYSIOLOGY**: Simultaneous interaction between both interstitial longings and status dichotomies.

---

- **INCOMPATIBILITY AXIOM**: Functionality and Perdurability are not compatible in a mixed physiology system.

- **STATUS DECAY**: Interstitial process of physiological deterioration.

--- 

## Part 5: Attributes Synthesis

- **ORGANIC SYNTHESIS**: Modulation of interstitial anatomy by organic physiology. 

- **INSTRUMENTAL SYNTHESIS**: Modulation of interstitial anatomy by instrumental physiology. 

- **MIXED SYNTHESIS**: Modulation of interstitial anatomy by mixed physiology. 

---

- **UNIFICATION SYNTHESIS**: Modulation of interstitial anatomy by perdurable dysfunctionality physiology. 

- **CONCILIATION SYNTHESIS**: Modulation of interstitial anatomy by imperdurable functionality physiology. 

- **CONCILIATION PATHWAY**: Iterated Imperdurable Functionality.

- **STATUS RECIPROCITY**: Correlation between attribute position and attribute disposition, influenced by mixed synthesis.
