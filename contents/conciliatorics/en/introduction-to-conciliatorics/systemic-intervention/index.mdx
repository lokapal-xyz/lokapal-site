title: Systemic Intervention
description: On entering the field.

Behavior Dynamics leads to **various types** of interactions and configurations, one of which is **Systemic Intervention**. This interaction is explicitly hierarchical and based on the member entity. 

- **SYSTEMIC INTERVENTION**: Action performed by a member that seeks to influence the behavior of a system.

- **INTERVENER**: Member that implements systemic intervention in a system.

A member's behavior can be intentional or non-intentional, localized or expansive, short-term based or planned ahead, etc. Systemic intervention is intentional, expansive, and planned ahead. This behavior designates a member as an **intervener**. That label does not preclude the member from holding other roles within the system. Many other interaction labels can be held by the same member. Further developments in Behavior Dynamics will introduce additional interaction labels.

Of the different subtypes of systemic interventions, we will narrow our focus to one that will serve as the main foundation of Conciliatorics: **Inventive Systemic Intervention**. For simplicity, we will refer to this subtype as **Inventive Intervention**. For now, any other subtypes will be categorized as **Non-Inventive Systemic Intervention**, to prevent diverging from our focus.

- **INVENTIVE SYSTEMIC INTERVENTION**: Exploration of a system's medium that seeks to influence its behavior.

Inventive intervention focuses on manipulating the medium before proceeding to its effects. This enhances the intended systemic intervention. While the medium is transformed to its desired state, the intervener can also improve their craftsmanship. This creates a complex feedback loop between the three systemic entities, further enhancing their behavior.

When multiple interveners are added to this feedback, and we consider the spatial and temporal dynamics, we end up with highly complex behavior. To effectively manage inventive intervention at this analytical level, we need a concise yet flexible foundation. So, to tackle this complexity, we will break it down into **distinct parcels**.
