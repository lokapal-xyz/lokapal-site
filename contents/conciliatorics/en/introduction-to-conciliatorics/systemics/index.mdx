title: Systemics
description: On what you can and can't grasp.

The analytical exploration of systems has taken many approaches over time. Some researchers have tackled the issue from established disciplines like mathematics, computer science, and philosophy. Others have developed approaches that treat systems as their starting point and main subject, such as cybernetics, systems theory, and ecology.

Due to the diverse nature of these approaches, integrating the knowledge derived from each field has always been a challenge. Attempts to address this challenge include general systems theory, systemics, and systems science. There is ongoing debate about what meta-discipline should group the collective knowledge related to systemsâ€”or even if such a meta-discipline is necessary. Some argue that the very nature of systems resists this type of consolidation.

For the purposes of this project, we will avoid this debate and assume the following:
- Systems can have a meta-discipline that encompasses its broad analytical work.
- For brevity, we will use the term "systemics" to refer to this meta-discipline.
- Systemics should not seek or force a total integration of concepts from each analytical approach.
- Systemics should serve as an analytical upper bound and container for knowledge related to systems.

With that in mind, we define the following:

- **SYSTEMICS**: A meta-discipline that groups different perspectives on the study of systems.

This meta-discipline prepares the foundation for our main topic: Conciliatorics. Now that we have addressed this, we can define the following:

- **CONCILIATORICS**: A perspective within Systemics that seeks to reconcile the inventive aspects of Systemic Intervention.

This preparation allows us to explore the content of the following chapters with a proper configuration:

- *Conciliatorics* serves as our container perspective. This means that any concept used here has its proper analytical context.
- *Systemics* serves as our meta-discipline. This means that concepts and ideas implemented here can coexist with other systems perspectives without the need for conceptual consolidation.

Now, let's begin with our starting point: **Behavior Dynamics**.
