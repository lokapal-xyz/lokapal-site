title: Inventive Edification
description: On peaks and legacy.

While self-contained inventive interventions can be useful, the most impactful ones are those that contribute to **Inventive Edification**—a process typically reserved for highly intelligent species. More fundamental forms of intervention remain accessible to a broader range of organisms.

- **INVENTIVE EDIFICATION**: Continuous and expansive development of inventive parcels.

| **INVENTIVE EDIFICATION** | **Intrinsicality** | **Interstitiality** |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Contemplation** | Edified Intrinsic Contemplation | Edified Interstitial Contemplation |
| **Transformation** | Edified Intrinsic Transformation | Edified Interstitial Transformation |

These edifications are the product of the progressive improvements of multiple interveners. They begin to resemble the complexities of human culture and industry. To help readers make clearer connections with familiar references, we will provide a set of **field associations** for each inventive edification.

| **INVENTIVE EDIFICATION** | **SYMBOL** | **FIELD** |
|------|:------:|-----|
| Edified Intrinsic Contemplation | `(cS)` | Sciences |
| Edified Intrinsic Transformation | `(tS)` | Technology |
| Edified Interstitial Contemplation | `)cS(` | Philosophy |
| Edified Interstitial Transformation | `)tS(` | The Arts |

Remember that these field associations are only intended to offer clearer references. They are not the main topics of discussion here, as each field's terminology comes with its own complexities, which might cause confusion in the context of Conciliatorics. The purpose is simply to provide a practical and familiar context. For example, if someone is unsure about what "edified intrinsic transformation" means, they can start by considering it *as related to* technology.

Additionally, we offer a set of symbols to provide a shorter representation. Here’s the breakdown of each symbol:

- Parentheses indicate position: `( )` for intrinsicality, `) (` for interstitiality.
- The lowercase `c` and `t` represent **Contemplation** and **Transformation**.
- The uppercase `S` refers to the Behavior Dynamics components.

The lower and uppercase formatting is not arbitrary; it emphasizes the subordination of inventive edification to the Behavior Dynamics components. In other words, the systemic components (uppercase S) take precedence over any form of inventive edification (lowercase c and t). This symbolic representation will expand in meaning in the next section.
