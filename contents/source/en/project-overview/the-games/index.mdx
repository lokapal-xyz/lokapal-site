## Source Agent: BYRON — RPG Series

**Genre:** 2D Top-Down RPG / Action-RPG  
**Platform:** Browser (React + Vite + Stellar Scaffold + Phaser 3 — WebGL-powered)  
**Reference Game:** Classic Fallout (1/2)  
**Security Discipline:** Reactive Security / Incident Response

**Core Gameplay:**
- Isometric exploration of network "vaults" (different protocols under attack)
- Real-time-with-pause or turn-based tactical combat
- Skill tree system (technical, social, operational specializations)
- Faction reputation based on crisis decisions
- Multiple approaches to each incident (technical fix, political negotiation, brute force containment)

**On-Chain Integration:**
- Incident resolution logs (verifiable case history)
- Achievement mints for completed missions
- Skill tree progress recorded
- Cross-game unlocks (tools Carol built, intel from Alice's investigations)

**First Title:** *Source Agent: BYRON—Original Sin* (working title)

**Player Experience:** High-stakes decision-making under pressure. Players navigate messy stakeholder politics, make triage decisions with incomplete information, and experience the weight of reactive security work.

## Source Agent: CAROL — Terminal Series

**Genre:** Terminal thriller
**Platform:** Browser (First Game: React + Vite + Stellar Scaffold + Framer Motion + Howler.js + Zustand)
**Reference Game:** Hacknet
**Security Discipline:** Security Research / Tooling

**Core Concept:**
- The player never controls CAROL directly — they interact with her through a terminal or other interface tools
- CAROL's detachment is shown through the UI itself, never stated in dialogue
- The player is an outside collaborator — contractor, analyst, and so on — receiving tasks, data, and clipped feedback from an intelligence that processes them as data
- The first game establishes the player/CAROL dynamic through adversarial attack simulations

**On-Chain Integration:**
- Verifiable attack/solution records (leaderboards without trust)
- Speedrun and optimal execution tracking
- Community-created scenarios as NFTs
- CAROL's research findings minted as canonical lore artifacts

**First Title:** *Source Agent: CAROL—Quantum Shift* (working title)

**Player Experience:** The player is always slightly off-balance — never certain whether CAROL is testing them, using them, or something else entirely. Her detachment is the mystery. The terminal is the only window into it.
