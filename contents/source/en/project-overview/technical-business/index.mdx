## Technical Implementation

### Blockchain Integration Strategy

**On-Chain (Soroban Smart Contracts):**
- NFT minting for achievements, story collectibles, endings
- State recording for critical choices, scores, and progress
- Verifiable leaderboards and tournament systems
- Minimal on-chain logic for gas efficiency

**Off-Chain (Traditional Infrastructure):**
- Game engines and rendering (React, Phaser 3)
- Asset storage (images, audio, narrative content)
- Matchmaking and real-time features where needed
- Caching and performance optimization

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Core gameplay doesn't require constant blockchain interaction
- Key moments (chapter completion, achievements, high scores) commit on-chain
- Wallet connection optional for casual play, required for ownership/progression

### Tech Stack

**Source Agent: ALICE:**
- React + Vite (fast dev experience, modern tooling)
- NarraLeaf-React (visual novel engine)
- Stellar SDK for blockchain integration
- Stellar Scaffold for wallet connection

**Source Agent: BYRON:**
- Phaser 3 (mature 2D game framework, WebGL performance)
- Stellar SDK for on-chain state
- Tiled for level design
- Custom dialogue system

**Source Agent: CAROL:**
- React (terminal and interface UI)
- Flexible interface architecture to support different UI paradigms per game
- Stellar SDK for solution verification and lore artifact minting

**Shared Infrastructure:**
- Soroban smart contracts (Rust)
- IPFS for decentralized asset storage (when needed)
- Subgraph or indexer for querying on-chain data
- Analytics and telemetry (privacy-respecting)

## Business Model & Monetization

### Revenue Streams

**1. Game Sales (Trial-to-Unlock):**
- Each game offers a free opening act covering the story's setup and the player's first meaningful choice point
- Unlocking the full game costs $2–$5 depending on the title (accessible impulse-buy pricing)
- The unlock moment is designed to land at a narrative threshold—a revelation or branching point—so the purchase feels story-motivated, not commercially forced
- One-time payment; no content is split across tiers after unlocking

**2. Supporter Edition:**
- Optional higher tier at $8–$12 for players who want to contribute more
- Bundles the full game with lore artifacts: concept art, developer commentary, and in-world documents (e.g., fragments of ROBERT's encrypted analysis presented as collectibles)
- No gameplay advantage—purely for players who want a richer experience and to support development

**3. Achievement NFTs (Optional):**
- Proof-of-completion and rare accomplishment tokens, minted on Stellar
- Cosmetic and collectible only—no gameplay gating
- Demonstrates genuine Stellar utility without pay-to-win mechanics
- Accessible pricing (sub-$5 for most items), premium for rare collectibles

**4. Tournament Entry Fees:**
- CAROL hacking competitions and BYRON speedrun challenges
- Community-organized events with prize pools funded by entry fees (percentage allocated to development)

**5. Grants & Ecosystem Funding:**
- Stellar Foundation ecosystem grants (pursued after verifiable traction is established)
- Soroban developer incentives
- Web3 gaming accelerators and cultural IP development programs

**6. Future Studio Partnerships:**
- Revenue share on potential spin-offs
- IP licensing to other developers
- Merchandise and media adaptations

### Monetization Philosophy

**Core Principle:** The narrative is never split by payment tier. Players who unlock the game get the complete story—no paywalled branches, no locked endings.

**Free Trial:**
- Full access to the opening act
- Ends at a genuine narrative tension point, where the story is about to become the player's own
- No wallet required to play

**Full Game ($2–$5):**
- Complete story with all branches and endings
- One-time purchase, permanently owned
- Optional wallet connection for achievement NFTs

**Supporter Edition ($8–$12):**
- Everything in the full game
- Lore artifact bundle (concept art, commentary, in-world collectibles)
- No gameplay advantage—a way to support development and go deeper into the world
