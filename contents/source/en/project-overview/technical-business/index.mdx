## Technical Implementation

### Blockchain Integration Strategy

**On-Chain (Soroban Smart Contracts):**
- NFT minting for achievements, story collectibles, endings
- State recording for critical choices, scores, and progress
- Verifiable leaderboards and tournament systems
- Minimal on-chain logic for gas efficiency

**Off-Chain (Traditional Infrastructure):**
- Game engines and rendering (React, Phaser 3)
- Asset storage (images, audio, narrative content)
- Matchmaking and real-time features where needed
- Caching and performance optimization

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Core gameplay doesn't require constant blockchain interaction
- Key moments (chapter completion, achievements, high scores) commit on-chain
- Wallet connection optional for casual play, required for ownership/progression

### Tech Stack

**Source Agent: ALICE:**
- React + Vite (fast dev experience, modern tooling)
- NarraLeaf-React (visual novel engine)
- Stellar SDK for blockchain integration
- Stellar Scaffold for wallet connection

**Source Agent: BYRON:**
- Phaser 3 (mature 2D game framework, WebGL performance)
- Stellar SDK for on-chain state
- Tiled for level design
- Custom dialogue system

**Source Agent: CAROL:**
- React (terminal and interface UI)
- Flexible interface architecture to support different UI paradigms per game
- Stellar SDK for solution verification and lore artifact minting

**Shared Infrastructure:**
- Soroban smart contracts (Rust)
- IPFS for decentralized asset storage (when needed)
- Subgraph or indexer for querying on-chain data
- Analytics and telemetry (privacy-respecting)
