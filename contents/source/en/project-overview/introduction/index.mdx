## What is Source Agents?

**Source Agents** is a Stellar gaming franchise with transmedia storytelling where three Artificial Sentient Intelligence defenders—ALICE, BYRON, and CAROL—protect the blockchain ecosystem from security threats. Each character leads their own game series in a distinct genre (visual novel, RPG, terminal thriller), creating an interconnected universe that pioneers narrative-driven Web3 entertainment while demonstrating Stellar capabilities beyond DeFi.

## Executive Summary

**Vision:** Establish Source Agents as one of the Stellar's flagship consumer entertainment IP—proving blockchain can support culturally rich, narratively compelling games where Web3 integration enhances rather than dominates the experience.

**Differentiation:** 
- First narrative-driven gaming franchise native to Stellar
- Three distinct genres unified by coherent lore and security themes
- Characters originate from Stellar tutorial documentation (Alice, Bob/Robert, Carol)
- Genre variety attracts diverse player demographics while building shared universe
- Educational without being pedagogical—players experience blockchain elements and security mindsets through gameplay

**Market Positioning:** Premium indie games with blockchain benefits (true ownership, persistent state, verifiable achievements) rather than crypto-games with forced tokenomics.

## Why Stellar?

### Strategic Platform Choice

**Source Agents is built on Stellar not despite its institutional reputation, but because of it.**

**Thematic Alignment:**
- Stellar = security, institutional trust, real-world asset focus
- Source Agents = security heroes defending a network built on reliability
- The stories we tell are authentic to the platform's core identity
- "Security-focused games on the security-focused chain" is powerful positioning

**Technical Advantages:**
- **Low transaction costs:** Minting story NFTs, recording choices, claiming achievements costs pennies
- **Fast finality:** Instant confirmation for game actions and leaderboards
- **Verifiable state:** No centralized servers needed for high scores, puzzle solutions, or progress
- **Developer experience:** Rust smart contracts, excellent documentation, growing tooling

**Ecosystem Opportunity:**
- Stellar lacks consumer entertainment applications—Source Agents fills this gap
- Stellar Foundation has strong incentives to support as proof of platform versatility
- Less competition than saturated EVM gaming markets
- Partnership potential impossible to replicate on crowded chains
