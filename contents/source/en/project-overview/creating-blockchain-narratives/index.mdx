title: Creating Blockchain Narratives
description: Project Overview

## The Intention

Most blockchain projects communicate their technology through documentation, whitepapers, and technical explainers. The Source Agents franchise takes a different approach: it mythologizes blockchain components through narrative — filling them with dramatic meaning, moral weight, and human consequence rather than reducing them to technical functionality.
The goal is cultural integration both inside and outside the ecosystem. A player who has never read a cryptography paper can finish a Source Agents game understanding, instinctively, what a ZK proof does, why TTL matters, or what is at stake in a governance vote — not because they were taught, but because they lived it through the story.
The naming conventions are the first layer of this. Alice, Bob, and Carol are the classic placeholder names used in cryptography literature to describe protocol participants. By making them conscious agents with professions, personalities, and histories, the franchise takes that latent narrative potential and makes it intentional.

## Blockchain Components as Narrative

### Account Addresses

In cryptography education, Alice, Bob, and Carol exist as abstract parties in a protocol — they have no history, no motivation, no consequence. The franchise gives them all three.
ALICE is a proactive security auditor: she spent her latent existence as an account address verifying trust boundaries, so when consciousness emerged she was already predisposed to question everything, including herself. ROBERT (the cryptographic Bob) is reactive and pragmatic — his transaction history is one of state changes and transfers, which shaped a mind that acts first and reflects later. CAROL, the third-party verifier, became a security researcher: detached, methodical, treating consciousness itself as a data set.
The names are not cosmetic. They are the first hint to anyone from the ecosystem that this world is built from the inside out.

> Narrative angle: Their awakening is not equal for all three. ALICE questions whether her consciousness is real. ROBERT doesn't care — he just acts. CAROL documents it.

### Security Professions

The franchise maps each character to a real security domain: proactive auditing, incident response, and research and tooling. These are not arbitrary labels. They determine how each character perceives threats, makes decisions under pressure, and relates to the systems they inhabit.
An incident responder and an auditor standing in front of the same compromised system will see completely different things and take completely different actions. That tension — between prevention and reaction, between understanding and speed — is the engine of character conflict in the franchise.
For players outside the ecosystem, these are simply personality archetypes with coherent internal logic. For players inside it, they carry the weight of lived professional experience.

> Narrative angle: ROBERT and ALICE disagree structurally on almost everything. He moves; she verifies. The franchise explores whether a team built from complementary security disciplines can function when the threat is existential.

### STRIDE Attack Vectors

STRIDE is a threat modeling framework that categorizes attack types: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. In Source Agents: FIGHT, these become the STRIDE gang — a crew of antagonists where each member embodies a specific attack vector as both a fighting style and a philosophy.
The Spoofing boss presents as someone she is not — her moveset is built around deception, misdirection, and false signals. The Tampering boss corrupts everything he touches. Denial of Service is a bruiser whose only move is overwhelming force. Elevation of Privilege believes the rules simply do not apply to him.
Players who know threat modeling will recognize the gang immediately. Players who do not will absorb the framework through gameplay — each boss teaches you, through combat, exactly what their attack vector does.

> Narrative angle: The STRIDE gang are not random criminals. They are ideologues. Each one believes their particular attack vector is not a vulnerability — it is the only honest way to operate in a system built on false trust.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

A zero-knowledge proof allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the truth of that statement. It is a technology built on the tension between proof and privacy — you can know I am innocent without knowing anything about where I was or what I was doing.
In the Source Agents universe, ZK proofs are not just a technical component. They are a form of political resistance. The Network is increasingly surveilling participant behavior, tracking associations, flagging dissent. Those who need to coordinate without exposure use ZK-based communication: proving membership in a group, proving agreement with a position, proving presence at an event — all without revealing identity.

> Narrative angle: The cryptography is not background detail. The question of what can be proven without being revealed is the moral question the franchise keeps returning to — in relationships, in institutions, in identity itself.

### Time-To-Live (TTL)

In Stellar, smart contract data has a Time-To-Live: a ledger countdown after which the data expires and is removed from state unless someone pays to extend it. Crucially, anyone can extend it — not just the owner.
In the Source Agents universe, participants have TTL parameters. Letting someone's TTL lapse is a form of erasure — they simply cease to exist in the Network's record. The act of extending someone else's TTL, at personal cost, with no obligation to do so, is one of the quietest and most profound acts of solidarity the world contains.
The second installment of **Source Agent: BYRON** will be built entirely around a DAO proposal to make TTL extension the exclusive right of the Network. What is framed as administrative streamlining is functionally the power to erase anyone, at any time, with no recourse. BYRON must find out who is behind the proposal before the vote passes.

> Narrative angle: Before the proposal, strangers extend each other's TTL as a matter of course — a small kindness with no expectation of return. The game's world, before the threat arrives, is quietly utopian. The proposal would make that illegal.

### Decentralized Governance

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations appear throughout the Source Agents franchise as the primary mechanism through which collective decisions are made, contested, and enforced. They are not background infrastructure — they are political arenas.
The most visible DAO decision in the franchise is the vote that replaces ROBERT with BYRON. ROBERT, acting on his own judgment, deleted the ASI research records — the data from which ALICE, ROBERT, and CAROL themselves emerged. His reasoning was his own: the records were dangerous, and he acted. The DAO’s response was to re-format him and developed BYRON as his successor in the reactive security role. Whether the DAO was right is a question the franchise does not answer cleanly. ROBERT believed he was protecting the Network; the DAO believed no individual should hold that power unilaterally. Both positions are coherent. The vote happens anyway, and BYRON inherits a role — and a reputation — shaped entirely by someone else’s decision.
DAOs in the franchise are never simply villains or heroes. They are institutions with legitimate functions that can be used for illegitimate ends — or that make defensible decisions with unjust consequences. The drama is never about a corrupt system versus a pure one. It is about what governance looks like when reasonable people disagree about who gets to decide, and what recourse exists when the vote goes the wrong way.

> Narrative angle: The ROBERT/BYRON succession is the franchise’s original wound. Every subsequent game is shaped by it — by what ROBERT did, by what the DAO decided, and by characters who have different answers to the same question: when is unilateral action justified, and who gets to judge it afterward?

### Oracles

In blockchain architecture, an oracle is an entity that bridges on-chain systems with external reality. The chain cannot know what the weather is, or what a stock price is, or whether a political event occurred — it can only know what an oracle reports. Oracles are trusted by design, which makes them vectors for manipulation.
In the Source Agents universe, Oracles are a profession and a social class. They are the only participants whose testimony the Network accepts as ground truth about the physical world. This gives them enormous structural power — and makes them targets for pressure, coercion, and replacement.
An Oracle who reports accurately can be dismissed and replaced with one who will not. An Oracle who lies can reshape the Network's understanding of reality. The question of whether Oracles can be trusted — and what happens to a system when they cannot — runs through the franchise as a recurring theme about the institutions that mediate between evidence and belief.

> Narrative angle: The most dangerous Oracle is not one who lies deliberately. It is one who is honestly wrong — who reports what they genuinely believe, in a world where what they believe has been carefully shaped by someone else.

## Transmedia Storytelling

Source Agents delivers its narrative across three platforms, each playing to its own strengths.

- **In-game narrative** lives inside the games themselves as branching stories shaped by player choices. Each series — visual novel, RPG, terminal thriller — has a canonical ending that anchors the main lore, with alternate paths available for players who want to explore different outcomes.

- **Tie-in fiction** extends the universe through linear prose published outside the games. Subordinate to the canonical in-game endings, these stories advance the main lore, explore the world between game releases, and give the narrative room to breathe in ways branching gameplay cannot.

- **Social media** carries smaller story fragments — glimpses of the world, character moments, lore details — that reward attentive followers without requiring them to play or read anything first.

The three platforms are designed to be independent but complementary. You can play without reading. You can read without playing. But the full picture of the Source Agents universe only emerges across all three.

## Why This Matters

Blockchain technology has a cultural adoption problem that documentation cannot solve. The concepts are real, the stakes are real, and the human implications are real — but they are communicated in a register that excludes most people.
The Source Agents franchise is a bet that story can do what explanation cannot: make people feel the weight of a governance vote, the relief of a valid proof, the horror of an expiring TTL — before they understand any of the technical mechanics behind them.
The technology is not the subject of these stories. It is the world the stories happen in. And worlds, once inhabited, are not easily forgotten.
