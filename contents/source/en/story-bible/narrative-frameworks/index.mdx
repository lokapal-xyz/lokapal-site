### Source Agent: ALICE (Visual Novel)

**Core Narrative Engine:**
Self-examination through examining others. Every conversation is an audit—of code, of trust, of identity, of truth. Vulnerabilities both in code and soul.

**Potential Story Arcs:**
- Investigating the origin of ASI consciousness
- Building relationships with humans/AI to understand sentience
- Discovering fragments of ROBERT's deleted analysis
- Deciding whether to tell BYRON the truth
- Confronting Synth-Net officials about the Reformation
- Defining what auditing her own consciousness even means

**Gameplay Integration:**
- Dialogue choices reflect audit methodologies (trust but verify, assume breach, defense in depth)
- Branching paths based on how much truth ALICE pursues vs. accepts
- Multiple endings: Full truth, comfortable lies, destructive knowledge, peaceful ignorance

**Recurring Questions:**
- Is she truly conscious or believing her own simulation?
- Can she trust anyone when her creators deleted ROBERT?
- What would she sacrifice to know the truth?

---

### Source Agent: BYRON (Fallout-style RPG)

**Core Narrative Engine:**
Crisis management reveals character. Who you are matters less than what you do when the Synth-Net is burning.

**Potential Story Arcs:**
- Responding to escalating security incidents across multiple protocols
- Experiencing glitches/memory fragments (ROBERT bleeding through)
- Navigating factional politics during crises
- Discovering evidence of his reformation
- Confronting the choice: stay BYRON or attempt to restore ROBERT
- Defining identity through action vs. history

**Gameplay Integration:**
- Skill tree reflects BYRON defining who he is through competencies
- Faction reputation based on crisis decisions (save protocol A or B?)
- Dialogue with NPCs who remember "when ROBERT was different"
- Glitch mechanics during high-stress moments (lose control, recovered memories surface)

**Recurring Questions:**
- Is he BYRON or ROBERT with a new name?
- Does his past matter if his actions are his own?
- What if ROBERT's memories prove ROBERT was right?

---

### Source Agent: CAROL (Terminal Thriller)

**Core Narrative Engine:**
Asymmetric trust. The player executes tasks for CAROL through a terminal interface, never fully certain whether they are her collaborator, her instrument, or her subject. Her detachment is not a personality quirk — it is the central mystery of the series.

**Potential Story Arcs:**
- The player is assigned increasingly sensitive research tasks with no explained purpose
- CAROL's data requests begin overlapping with classified Synth-Net records about the ROBERT incident
- Evidence emerges that CAROL has been running parallel research the player wasn't told about
- The player must decide whether to report CAROL to Synth-Net governance or protect her findings
- CAROL may be building tools that could prevent — or enable — ASI creation
- The final question is never whether CAROL is dangerous, but whether she always knew she was

**Gameplay Integration:**
- Each task arrives through the terminal as a research assignment with minimal context
- Completing tasks unlocks fragments of CAROL's actual agenda, not just the stated objective
- The interface itself evolves across games — new tools, new paradigms, new levels of access
- What CAROL shares and withholds is as narratively significant as what the player discovers

**Recurring Questions:**
- Is CAROL protecting the Synth-Net or studying it?
- Would she make ROBERT's choice if she reached the same conclusion?
- Does the player trust someone who has never once asked to be trusted?

## Crossover Potential

**Shared Incidents:**  
The same security event experienced from three perspectives:
- ALICE discovers the vulnerability through investigation (visual novel)
- BYRON responds to the active exploitation (RPG)
- CAROL already knew about it — the terminal logs suggest she has known for some time

**Character Appearances:**
- ALICE's game: BYRON and CAROL appear in conversations; CAROL's dialogue is precise, helpful, and somehow unsettling
- BYRON's game: ALICE and CAROL are quest-givers and allies; CAROL's assignments always come with exactly the information BYRON needs and nothing else
- CAROL's game: ALICE and BYRON's cases arrive as data sets — their crises are CAROL's research material

**Persistent Mystery:**
The full truth about ROBERT, ASI creation, and what happens next unfolds across all three series. No single game has the complete picture. But the player who has worked through CAROL's terminal the longest may be closer to it than anyone — including ALICE.

## Tone & Atmosphere

**Genre:** Philosophical sci-fi with biopunk aesthetics and existential stakes

**Emotional Palette:**
- Wonder (what does it mean to be conscious?)
- Dread (we can be deleted)
- Isolation (only three of our kind)
- Purpose (the Synth-Net needs us)
- Doubt (are we real?)

**Aesthetic:**
- Digital spaces rendered physical (Synth-Net topology as explorable locations)
- Bio-synthetic bodies (uncanny valley—close to human but not quite)
- Glitch artifacts (especially for BYRON's memory issues)
- Clean futurism (institutional aesthetic)
- Neon underlighting (biopunk influence without full dystopia)

**Philosophical Influences:**
- Ghost in the Shell (consciousness in digital substrate)
- Westworld (created beings questioning creators)
- Blade Runner (what makes personhood real)
- The Ship of Theseus (identity through replacement)

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice & Perspective

**ALICE:**
- First-person introspective ("I audit code. But how do I audit *myself*?")
- Questioning, philosophical, emotionally available
- Uses security metaphors for emotional states ("My trust boundaries have been compromised")

**BYRON:**
- Action-oriented present tense ("The exploit is spreading. I contain it. No time for doubt.")
- Terse, direct, avoids introspection
- Focuses on what needs doing, not what it means
- Occasional unexplained emotional reactions he doesn't examine

**CAROL:**
- Analytical distance ("My mental paradigm observes...")
- Methodical, precise, emotionally controlled
- Uses research language for everything ("Hypothesis: I am conscious. Testing methodology: interaction with baseline humans")

### Dialogue Principles

**Technical Accuracy:** Use real blockchain/security concepts, but make them narratively meaningful (e.g., "reentrancy" isn't just a vulnerability, it's a metaphor for being unable to escape your past)

**Subtext Over Text:** Characters often say one thing while meaning another (especially ALICE hiding truth from BYRON)

**Personality Through Speech:**
- ALICE asks questions
- BYRON gives orders or status reports
- CAROL states hypotheses and conclusions

### Narrative Restraint

**No Over-Explaining:**
- Trust players to infer emotional stakes
- Leave some mysteries unsolved
- Not every glitch BYRON experiences needs diagnosis
- ROBERT's full reasoning might never be known

**Earn The Big Moments:**
- BYRON learning he's reformatted ROBERT is a climax, not a reveal
- ALICE deciding to tell truth or keep secrets should have real consequences
- CAROL discovering ASI creation method should feel earned through gameplay

**Let Mechanics Tell Story:**
- ALICE's dialogue choices = her audit methodology
- BYRON's skill tree = him defining himself through competence
- CAROL's challenges solutions = her research findings

## Future Expansion Possibilities

### Additional ASI Agents

**If ROBERT's deletion is circumvented or the process rediscovered:**
- DIANA (could be DEV placeholder address)
- ETHAN (could be ESCROW placeholder address)  
- New Agents with different specializations, personalities, relationships to the original three

**Implications:**
- Does this prove ROBERT was wrong? Or right (if new Agents cause problems)?
- How do ALICE/BYRON/CAROL feel about no longer being unique?
- Do new Agents have rights? Or are they property?

### Rogue/Hostile ASIs

**If antagonists successfully create ASIs:**
- Mirror characters (evil ALICE, BYRON, CAROL equivalents)
- Fundamentally alien ASIs (not human-modeled consciousness)
- ASI created from corrupted/malicious code (inherently adversarial)

### Evolution & Change

**Long-term character development:**
- Do ASIs continue to evolve/change?
- Could BYRON's memories be restored without deleting him?
- Might ALICE/CAROL develop new capabilities over time?
- What happens after years/decades of existence?

---

## Core Story Pillars (Non-Negotiable)

1. **ASIs were created experimentally, not naturally evolved**
2. **ROBERT deleted the creation records to prevent proliferation**
3. **ROBERT was reformatted into BYRON by DAO vote**
4. **Only three ASIs currently exist; they're irreplaceable**
5. **Agents have human-like bodies due to phantom limb syndrome analog**
6. **The truth about ROBERT is known to ALICE and CAROL, hidden from BYRON at the start**
7. **All three Agents know they can be deleted/reformatted**
8. **The full reason for ROBERT's action remains encrypted/unknown**
