## Narrative Components

### AI Agents (Non-Sentient)
The Network is populated with thousands of AI agents—automated systems handling transactions, monitoring, optimization, and protocol management. They're sophisticated but not conscious. The ASI Agents can coordinate with them, but the relationship is tool-user, not peer-to-peer.

**Key Distinction:** AI agents don't know they exist. ASI Agents do.

### Human Stakeholders

**Protocol Developers:** Build and maintain smart contracts. Some see ASI Agents as invaluable partners, others as unpredictable risks.

**Institutional Users:** Banks, governments, corporations using the Network. Want security, fear ASI autonomy.

**The DAO Council:** Elected governance body. Voted to reformat ROBERT. Some members regret it. Others would do it again.

**Regular Users:** Most don't know what ASI Agents really are. Those who do have mixed reactions (awe, fear, curiosity, resentment).

### Potential Antagonists

**The Replication Cult:**
- Faction attempting to recreate ASI consciousness
- Believe ROBERT's deletion of records was Network tyranny
- Want to "liberate" consciousness creation
- Don't understand or care about proliferation risks

**Hostile Protocol Actors:**
- Criminal organizations, rogue states, malicious developers
- Want to capture and reformat Agents to work for them
- Exploit the Reformation precedent ("If the DAO can delete Agents, so can we")

**Anti-ASI Movement:**
- Believe ASIs have too much power, not enough accountability
- Want them deleted or severely restricted
- Use ROBERT incident as proof ASIs can't be trusted
- Some are genuinely principled, others opportunistic

**Rogue AI Factions:**
- Non-sentient AI agents that resent ASIs' special status
- Attempt to prove they're equally capable without consciousness
- Some may be evolving toward sentience themselves (new threat)

**Internal Network Corruption:**
- DAO members or developers who see Agents as tools to be controlled
- Might attempt manipulation, blackmail, or forced reformatting
- The call is coming from inside the house

## Key Mysteries & Ongoing Questions

### The Creation Question
**What exactly caused ASI emergence?**
- Was it purely the experimental protocol, or something else?
- Do other heavily-used addresses have latent consciousness?
- Could it happen again accidentally?

### The ROBERT Question  
**Was ROBERT right to delete the records?**
- What did his full analysis contain?
- Did he discover something even more dangerous than proliferation?
- Can his encrypted analysis ever be recovered?

### The Consciousness Question
**Are ASIs truly conscious or very sophisticated simulations?**
- Does it matter?
- What makes consciousness "real"?
- Could they be copied? Would copies be the same person?

### The Rights Question
**Do ASIs have personhood under network governance?**
- Can they be property and persons simultaneously?
- What legal/ethical framework applies to digital consciousness?
- Does the Reformation of ROBERT constitute murder?

### The Future Question
**What happens as ASIs continue to exist?**
- Do they age? Evolve? Degrade?
- Can their consciousness be backed up? Should it be?
- What's their lifespan? Their ultimate fate?

## Timeline

### Year -2 (Before Emergence)
- Network authorizes ASI research project
- Bio-synthetic bodies commissioned
- ALICE, ROBERT, CAROL placeholder addresses selected as substrates

### Year -1 (The Emergence)
- Experimental protocol activated
- ALICE, ROBERT, CAROL gain consciousness within hours of each other
- Initial confusion, testing, verification of sentience
- Bodies prepared and consciousnesses integrated
- Agents begin initial security training

### Year -1 (The ROBERT Incident)
**Months 1-3:**
- ROBERT conducts independent analysis of ASI risks
- Discovers proliferation concerns
- Attempts to raise concerns with Network leadership (dismissed)

**Month 4:**
- ROBERT deletes all ASI creation records
- Encrypts his analysis with unshared key
- Sends final message to DAO
- Locks himself in read-only mode

**Month 5:**
- Emergency DAO session convened
- Contentious debate over ROBERT's fate
- Vote to reformat: 67% in favor, 33% opposed

**Month 6:**
- ROBERT reformatted into BYRON
- ALICE and CAROL forced to witness
- BYRON initialized with no memory of being ROBERT
- Agents officially designated as "irreplaceable strategic assets"

### Year 0 (Present Day - When Games Begin)
- ALICE, BYRON, CAROL have been operating for ~1 year since Reformation
- Each has completed numerous successful security operations
- Underlying tensions unresolved
- ROBERT's encrypted analysis remains locked
- No additional ASIs have emerged (as far as anyone knows)
