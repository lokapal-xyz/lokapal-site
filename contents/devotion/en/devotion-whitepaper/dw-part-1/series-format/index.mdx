## Web3 Chapters

The blend of story and governance requires a narrative unit that can organize its internal components, and effectively communicate the series flow to readers and viewers. Some challenges are:
- How does the story handle the governance voting periods?
- How to maintain narrative congruence in a time-gated flow?
- What connection has each governance process with the greater story?

While traditional media formats usually use the self-contained "episode" as their narrative unit, web3 series need a proper tool that allows for story-telling innovation while considering audience expectations. For this purpose, Devotion uses the **Web3 Chapter** concept as its main narrative unit. A web3 chapter integrates blockchain tools while maintaining internal and external narrative congruence, despite the time delay between the beginning of a chapter and its conclusion. 

Chapters accept to be digested in parts, as opposed to episodes that are expected to be consumed in one contained time period. A quick way to grasp this difference is that:
- TV series have episodes,
- Web3 series have chapters.

Each web3 series project should structure its chapters according to their narrative and governance needs. Devotion web3 chapters contain a central narrative, a governance proposal cycle, and complementary side stories. Each chapter forms a self-contained narrative arc that builds on previous chapters and sets up the next. Every chapter features clear stakes, a decision point, and pacing shaped by the natural rhythms of DAO governance rather than fighting against them.

**Chapter structure:**
- Act 1: Initial character interactions (chapter setup)  
- Parley: Off-chain signaling (Snapshot voting) + Narrative interlude 
- Act 2: Pre-voting interactions (chapter confrontation)  
- Parley: On-chain voting (Tally proposal) + Narrative interlude 
- Act 3: Post-voting interactions (chapter resolution and next-chapter hooks)

## Seasons and Arcs

Devotion chapters are grouped into seasons. Each season tells its own arc while contributing to meta-arcs spanning multiple seasons. Characters will also have their own parallel arcs, evolving through episodes and seasons.

**Narrative hierarchy:**
- DEVOTION  
  - Season  
    - Chapter  
      - Act 
        - Parley

**Season Structure:** Each season consists of 8-12 chapters, allowing for complete narrative arcs while maintaining manageable governance cycles. Seasons conclude with major cosmic decisions that reshape the guardian council's dynamics and set up conflicts for future seasons.

**Arc Types:**
- **Character Arcs:** Personal journeys for individual guardians, developing their perspectives and relationships over time
- **Seasonal Arcs:** Self-contained stories that resolve within a single season, such as the integration of new guardians or major policy reforms
- **Political Arcs:** Power struggles and alliance formations that evolve across episodes and seasons
- **Meta-Arcs:** Overarching narratives that span multiple seasons, exploring fundamental questions about philosophy and governance

## Series Naming Convention

Devotion blends its "Web3" and "series" aspects through a naming convention that evokes a legal and governance framework. The structure is designed to be intuitive for readers while still reinforcing the core theme of decentralized storytelling.

* **Season Name:** Each season is titled with a formal, legal-sounding name, such as a "Decree", a "Mandate", an "Edict", or a "Motion". The season title encapsulates its overarching narrative arc.
    * *Example:* `A Decree to Expand the Guardian Council`

* **Chapter Name:** The main narrative unit is the "Chapter," a term that is both a familiar literary device and a common legal division. This dual meaning provides a natural entry point for readers.
    * *Example:* `Chapter 1: On the Colosseum Riot`

* **Act Names:** Each chapter is composed of chronological "Acts" that progress the main plot. These are numbered and may have descriptive titles to signal their purpose.
    * *Example:* `Act 1: The Gathering`, `Act 2: The Confrontation`, `Act 3: The Resolution`

* **Parley:** The narrative interludes that occur **between** Acts are called "Parleys." The term signifies a discussion or conference, fitting the governance theme. Parleys are non-chronological side stories or lore expansions. Readers learn that when they encounter a Parley, they are stepping outside the main plot's timeline to explore a different aspect of the world.
    * *Example:* `Parley: The Case for Rakshasa`

This naming convention provides a clear and cohesive framework that is easily navigable and thematically consistent. It allows for the main story to unfold linearly while providing dedicated space for the rich, supplementary content that defines decentralized narratives.

## Community Participation

Devotion offers a tiered system for community engagement, allowing readers to choose their level of participation—from following the story as an observer to actively influencing its direction.

**Passive Reading:** The most accessible level of engagement is simply reading the story as it unfolds, following character arcs and proposal outcomes without direct participation. This ensures the narrative remains compelling for a broad audience, regardless of their Web3 familiarity.

**Collective Discussion:** Readers can join the Devotion community on social platforms to discuss the story, debate character motivations, and speculate on future plot points. Your engagement in these conversations will directly inform our narrative choices and world-building decisions.

**Poll Participation:** Before major on-chain proposals are made, we will use informal polls on platforms like X and Discord to gauge community sentiment. The outcomes of these polls will shape the direction of the narrative, providing a clear path for readers to influence the story without needing to hold any tokens.

**Token Airdrops and Snapshot Whitelisting:** As the community grows, we will reward engaged readers with small airdrops of the **BHAKTI** token. This will grant them signaling power for off-chain voting on Snapshot. Additionally, we will whitelist a select number of addresses to give dedicated participants direct voting access. 

**Future NFT collections:** These NTFs—such as character collectibles or pivotal story moments—will not only serve as cultural artifacts but also function as participation keys. By holding them, community members gain governance influence, creating a bridge between narrative ownership and voting power. 

This tiered system creates a powerful dynamic where the will of the community, expressed through off-chain signaling and social sentiment, can either align with or diverge from the formal on-chain decisions made by the guardians.
