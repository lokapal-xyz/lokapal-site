title: '1.3 Narrative Structure Taxonomy for Web3 Series'
description: 'Part 1: Project Overview'
---

## Purpose

This taxonomy is provided as a reference for the broader web3 entertainment community. Projects may adopt any of these structures in their original form or create further modifications to suit their specific storytelling and governance needs. We encourage citation of this framework to help establish common terminology for the emerging field of decentralized narrative entertainment.


## A. Three-Act Structure
The classical narrative framework consisting of Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2), and Resolution (Act 3). This traditional structure forms the foundation for most dramatic storytelling across all media formats. Each act serves a distinct purpose in advancing the story while maintaining clear dramatic tension and pacing.


## B. Three-Act Structure with Interludes
> *"You see, I never speak of Agatha, because even at the thought of her name, I'm unable to control my emotions. Well, I suppose there's no way around it. You see, she saved us."*  
> — Zero, *The Grand Budapest Hotel*

An enhancement of the classical format that introduces autonomous or semi-autonomous narrative segments between acts. These interludes operate independently of the main story's chronology and can explore character backstories, world-building elements, parallel storylines, or future/past events. The interludes serve as narrative satellites that enrich the core story without disrupting its dramatic flow.

**Structure:**
- Act 1: Setup
- Narrative Interlude A: Lore expansion / Character development
- Act 2: Confrontation  
- Narrative Interlude B: Lore expansion / Character development
- Act 3: Resolution


## C. Three-Act Structure with Governance
> *"I've got a proposition to make. I want to call for a vote. I want eleven men to vote by secret ballot. I'll abstain. If there are still eleven votes for guilty, I won't stand alone. We'll take in a guilty verdict right now."*  
> — Juror #8, *12 Angry Men*

A web3-native format that integrates decentralized governance mechanisms into the traditional three-act framework. Unlike simple audience participation or polling, governance involves structured decision-making processes that carry real consequences for narrative progression. The governance breaks create natural pause points where collective consensus shapes story outcomes through formal voting mechanisms.

**Structure:**
- Act 1: Setup
- Governance Break A: Decision-making process
- Act 2: Confrontation
- Governance Break B: Decision-making process  
- Act 3: Resolution


## D. Three-Act Structure with Parley
> *"That's the one! Parley!"*  
> *"Parley? Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead thought up parley!"*  
> *"That would be the French."*  
> — *Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl*

The comprehensive format combining both narrative interludes and governance mechanisms. This structure maximizes both storytelling depth and community engagement by allowing narrative exploration during governance periods. The Parley structure signals the promising variety of web3 storytelling capabilities. Devotion employs the Three-Act Structure with Parley.

**Structure:**
- Act 1: Setup
- Parley A: Governance Break + Narrative Interlude
- Act 2: Confrontation
- Parley B: Governance Break + Narrative Interlude
- Act 3: Resolution
