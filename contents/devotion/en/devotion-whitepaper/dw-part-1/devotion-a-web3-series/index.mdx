## What is Devotion?  
**Devotion** is a live-action myth, a living narrative where the audience doesn’t just watch the story—they become a part of its unfolding governance. Imagine a mythological epic where the fate of the characters is decided by a decentralized community. Devotion is that story.

## Why Combine Storytelling With Web3?  
Because culture is the bridge between technology and people. While Web3 has matured from being a technological novelty to an emerging social infrastructure, it still lacks a shared cultural fabric that resonates beyond its early adopters. Storytelling can carry the values, challenges, and opportunities of decentralized coordination into a form people can feel and remember. By anchoring these ideas in rich narratives and complex character-driven arcs, **Devotion** complements the often-meme-heavy Web3 culture with something more grounded, serious, and enduring—while still being imaginative and accessible.

## Target Audience  
**Devotion** is crafted for the intellectually curious reader who thrives at the intersection of story, philosophy, and technology. This reader loves myth and literature, is intrigued by emerging governance experiments, and seeks cultural projects that go deeper than memes or speculation. They are open to exploring new forms of collective storytelling and want to experience how decentralized decision-making can shape a narrative world they care about.

## Why Now?  
The Web3 ecosystem is at a turning point. The early rush of speculation has slowed, and builders are seeking narratives that express deeper purpose and staying power. At the same time, public discourse is grappling with issues of governance, coordination, and trust—both online and offline. **Devotion** enters at this intersection, using storytelling to give shape and meaning to the abstract mechanics of decentralized systems. By launching now, it captures an audience hungry for cultural artifacts that are both entertaining and intellectually engaging, while also demonstrating that blockchain tools can serve creative, civic, and philosophical ends—not just financial ones.
