## Cultural: Reimagine Myth in Decentralized Form
- **Showcase decentralized ethos through narrative tools.** Present the principles of shared power, transparency, and collective decision-making in an artistic framework, making abstract ideals tangible and memorable.
- **Promote collaborative storytelling.** Invite readers to influence the unfolding lore through interactive mechanisms, turning the audience into active co-creators rather than passive consumers.
- **Build cultural credibility for Web3.** Offer a serious, aesthetically rich project that demonstrates Web3’s potential beyond speculation and memes—especially for those outside the current blockchain community.


## Educational: DAO Governance Through Narrative
- **Introduce basic governance concepts.** Weave the mechanics of proposals, voting, and treasury management into the storyline so newcomers can learn them naturally.
- **Blend theory with engaging fiction.** Use narrative arcs and character choices to illustrate governance principles in ways that stick more than technical manuals ever could.
- **Encourage governance research through fiction.** Present speculative situations that may inspire DAO scholars, designers, and developers to explore new models and improvements.


## Experimental: Roleplay and Simulate Governance Workflows
- **Encourage engagement with governance.** Use in-world dilemmas—such as debates over how many tokens a character should hold—to get participants thinking about tokenomics, resource allocation, and policy-making without needing formal governance vocabulary.
- **Test unconventional technical configurations.** Introduce governance modules, contract setups, or treasury mechanisms in ways that serve the lore but may not follow common practice, allowing for low-stakes experimentation with new on-chain tools.
- **Explore socio-political tensions through narrative.** Present power struggles, centralization attempts, or factional conflicts in the story so participants can openly critique and debate them without the personal risks of real-world governance disputes.
