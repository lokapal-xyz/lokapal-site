title: Devotion Web3 Framework
description: 'Part 3: Web3 Framework'
---

The Devotion framework rests on a dual-governance model:  
- **Community Signaling** through the BHAKTI token  
- **Formal Authority** through the RAKSHA token  

This separation mirrors the balance between mortal devotion and divine guardianship.
