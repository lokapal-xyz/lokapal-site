## Narrative Arcs

Fealty chapters are grouped into books. Each book tells its own arc while contributing to meta-arcs spanning multiple books. Characters will also have their own parallel arcs, evolving through books and chapters.

**Narrative hierarchy:**
- FEALTY  
  - Book  
    - Chapter  
      - Act 
        - Parley

**Book Structure:** Each book consists of 8-12 chapters, allowing for complete narrative arcs while maintaining manageable governance cycles. Books conclude with major cosmic decisions that reshape the guardian council's dynamics and set up conflicts for future books.

**Arc Types:**
- **Character Arcs:** Personal journeys for individual guardians, developing their perspectives and relationships over time
- **Central Arcs:** Self-contained stories that resolve within a single book, such as the integration of new guardians or major policy reforms
- **Political Arcs:** Power struggles and alliance formations that evolve across chapters and books
- **Meta-Arcs:** Overarching narratives that span multiple books, exploring fundamental questions about philosophy and governance

## Naming Convention

Fealty uses a naming convention that evokes legal and governance frameworks. The structure is designed to be intuitive for readers while still reinforcing the core theme of decentralized storytelling.

* **Book Name:** Each book is titled with a formal, legal-sounding name, such as a "Decree", a "Mandate", an "Edict", or a "Motion". The book title encapsulates its overarching narrative arc.
    * *Example:* `A Decree to Expand the Guardian Council`

* **Chapter Name:** The main narrative unit is the "Chapter," a term that is both a familiar literary device and a common legal division. This dual meaning provides a natural entry point for readers.
    * *Example:* `Chapter 1: On the Colosseum Riot`

* **Act Names:** Each chapter is composed of chronological "Acts" that progress the main plot. These are numbered and may have descriptive titles to signal their purpose.
    * *Example:* `Act 1: The Gathering`, `Act 2: The Confrontation`, `Act 3: The Resolution`

* **Parley Names:** "Parleys" are non-chronological side stories or lore expansions, with a companion governance proposal. Readers learn that when they encounter a Parley, they are stepping outside the main plot's timeline to explore a different aspect of the world. Proposals use a conventional governance naming pattern, while narrative interludes have their own title format.
    * *Example:* `Parley: The Case for Rakshasa`

This naming convention provides a clear and cohesive framework that is easily navigable and thematically consistent. It allows for the main story to unfold linearly while providing dedicated space for the rich, supplementary content that defines decentralized narratives.

## Sigils of Fealty

Sigils of Fealty are the symbolic representation of allegiance within the *Fealty* universe and its governance framework. They exist in two distinct forms, reflecting the different roles of citizens and guardians.

* **BHAKTI Sigils of Fealty**: Represent the allegiance of citizens to their chosen guardian. They are implemented as **ERC-20 fungible tokens**, allowing citizens to transfer or reassign their loyalty over time.
* **RAKSHA Sigils of Fealty**: Represent the allegiance of guardians to the Trimurti. They are implemented as **ERC-721 soulbound tokens**, making them non-transferable and unique to each guardian.

This dual structure ensures that fealty is both measurable and differentiated: citizens express a flexible, collective form of allegiance, while guardians hold an immutable and personal bond. Together, the Sigils of Fealty create a unified system that links narrative, symbolism, and blockchain implementation.

## Community Participation

Fealty offers a tiered system for community engagement, allowing readers to choose their level of participation—from following the story as an observer to actively influencing its direction.

**Passive Reading:** The most accessible level of engagement is simply reading the story as it unfolds, following character arcs and proposal outcomes without direct participation. This ensures the narrative remains compelling for a broad audience, regardless of their Web3 familiarity.

**Collective Discussion:** Readers can join the Fealty community on social platforms to discuss the story, debate character motivations, and speculate on future plot points. Readers engagement in these conversations will directly inform our narrative choices and world-building decisions.

**Poll Participation:** Before major on-chain proposals are made, we will use informal polls on platforms like X and Discord to gauge community sentiment. The outcomes of these polls will shape the direction of the narrative, providing a clear path for readers to influence the story without needing to hold any tokens.

**Token Distribution and Snapshot Whitelisting:** As the community grows, we will establish a distribution channel of BAHKTI tokens. This will grant holders signaling power for off-chain voting on Snapshot. Additionally, we will whitelist a select number of addresses to give dedicated participants direct voting access. 

**Future NFT collections:** These NTFs—such as character collectibles or pivotal story moments—will not only serve as cultural artifacts but also function as participation keys. By holding them, community members gain governance influence, creating a bridge between narrative ownership and voting power. 

This tiered system creates a powerful dynamic where the will of the community, expressed through off-chain signaling and social sentiment, can either align with or diverge from the formal on-chain decisions made by the guardians.
