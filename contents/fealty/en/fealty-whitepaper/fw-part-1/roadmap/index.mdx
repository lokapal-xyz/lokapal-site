## Objectives 

The roadmap for Fealty follows a deliberate three-phase progression—from laying foundations, to engaging audiences, to gradually expanding into shared governance. Each phase builds on the previous, ensuring stability, narrative integrity, and long-term sustainability.

## Phase 1: Foundations *(Completed)*

This initial phase focused on experimentation and infrastructure.  
Key accomplishments include:
- Exploring different storytelling formats to identify those best suited for the project’s tone and goals.
- Developing character archetypes capable of supporting prolonged narrative development.
- Designing a Web3 framework that serves both governance mechanics and lore requirements.
- Planning a sustainable structure that begins under centralized direction and can later transition to community governance.
- Deploying the Fealty Web3 infrastructure.


## Phase 2: Engagement and Publishing *(Current)*

With the core vision and technical groundwork in place, the focus has shifted to visibility, audience building, and content delivery.  
Active priorities:
- Launching a website that connects readers to all components of Fealty.
- Promoting the project in both Web3-native and mainstream cultural spaces.
- Building an active social presence to foster conversation and anticipation.
- Integrating Fealty into the Lokapal ecosystem for educational, research, and public debate purposes.
- Establishing sustainable funding channels to support ongoing operations.


## Phase 3: Growth and Expansion *(Planned)*

This phase will guide Fealty into a community-driven future, while protecting the integrity of its story and governance design.  
Planned actions:
- Gradual transition to a shared community governance model, with decisions initially made by `lokapal.eth` but informed by community feedback.
- Introducing governance in controlled stages to ensure stability and safeguard the lore.
- Publishing comprehensive governance documentation, voting processes, and participation guidelines once key readiness milestones are met.
- Opening opportunities for lore contributions via contests, guest writing, and partnerships.
- Maintaining alignment between governance decisions, narrative coherence, and the Fealty universe.

Long-term sustainability will come from a hybrid model of cultural patronage (NFTs and collectibles), community support (grants, memberships, and partnerships), and integration into broader Web3 initiatives—ensuring that Fealty can grow without sacrificing narrative coherence or governance integrity.
