## Context

Fealty's narrative universe encompasses multiple realms and societies, each with distinct cultures, governance structures, and relationships to the Guardian Council. This section serves as a reference guide to the key locations that shape the story, from the mortal cities where policy impacts are felt most directly to the ethereal spaces where guardians convene. New locations will appear in this section as the story unfolds.


## Lanka Prime: The Mortal Metropolis

Lanka Prime serves as the central metropolis of the mortal realm, housing millions of inhabitants across ten distinct urban districts. Each district operates with specialized functions ranging from government and finance to industry and entertainment, creating a complex ecosystem of interconnected urban systems. 

As the largest concentration of mortal population and activity, Lanka Prime frequently becomes the focal point for Guardian Council deliberations regarding divine intervention in human affairs. The city's ten districts each present unique policy challenges that require careful consideration of when and how cosmic authority should engage with mortal governance. 

**The Districts of Lanka Prime:**

1.  **Ahamkara Plaza**  
    **- District Type: Government**  
    **- Vice: Ego**  
    **- Description:** The city's government and judicial headquarters, a gleaming monument to self-importance. This district is defined by towering, minimalist architecture and a maze of interconnected skywalks. The bureaucracy here is a perfect reflection of its core vice; every law, decree, and official act is designed to solidify the power and prestige of the ruling elite. It is a place of rigid order where personal ego is masked as public service.  

2.  **Lobha Exchange**  
    **- District Type: Central Business District**  
    **- Vice: Greed**  
    **- Description**: The financial heart of Lanka Prime, a cold, towering landscape of corporate headquarters and data servers. This is where the city's wealth is created, hoarded, and leveraged. This district operates on the principle that every transaction is a form of debt, and every human life is a potential asset. It is a place of pure, unadulterated greed, where profit is the only guiding principle.  

3.  **Mada Heights**  
    **- District Type: Academia / Upper Class Residential**  
    **- Vice: Arrogance**  
    **- Description**: An exclusive, high-class residential district and the center of the city's academic world. Its inhabitants, a mix of bio-engineers, data scientists, and artists, are defined by their intellectual and social pride. The district is pristine and meticulously organized, but beneath the veneer of beauty lies a deep-seated rot. Its residents' arrogance leads to stagnation and ethical decay, as they become so focused on their own superiority that they fail to see the corruption consuming them from within.  

4.  **Moha Citadel**   
    **- District Type: Cultural / Middle Class Residential**  
    **- Vice: Attachment**  
    **- Description**: A sprawling, interconnected network of middle-class residential sectors. This district is designed to provide a sanitized, utopian living experience, complete with holographic gardens and simulated sunsets. Citizens are so emotionally attached to their curated communities and digital lives that they become completely disconnected from the reality of the city. It is a place of communal living where attachment becomes a form of mass delusion, perfectly managed by the system.  

5.  **Matsarya Bazaar**   
    **- District Type: Commercial / Lower Class Residential**  
    **- Vice: Envy**  
    **- Description**: The commercial and lower-class residential sector, a sprawling, crowded labyrinth of back alleys and pop-up markets. Life here is a constant struggle for survival and betterment. The vice of envy permeates every aspect of this district, as its inhabitants constantly compare themselves to those in the wealthier parts of the city. This leads to a desperate race for advantage, often through back-alley deals or dangerous, black-market bio-enhancements in a desperate attempt to keep up.  

6.  **Buddhi Hub**   
    **- District Type: Technology**  
    **- Vice: Intellect**  
    **- Description**: A chaotic and vibrant technology district. This is the city's brain, a marketplace of ideas, data, and scientific experimentation. The mages and inventors who inhabit this space are driven by an insatiable curiosity, often leading to unpredictable and dangerous results. The district is a sensory overload of flickering holograms, whirring drones, and experimental code, where intellect is worshipped but often misused.  

7.  **Krodha Foundries**   
    **- District Type: Industrial**  
    **- Vice: Anger**  
    **- Description**: A grim, smoke-choked industrial sector where the city's anger is nurtured. The Foundries are a constant symphony of clanging metal, steam vents, and the low roar of machinery. The factories here run 24/7, fueled by the discontent of a working class that sees no path forward. The environment is harsh and unforgiving, a physical manifestation of a society's rage, ready to erupt at any moment.  

8.  **Ghrina Colosseum**   
    **- District Type: Sports**  
    **- Vice: Hate**  
    **- Description**: A series of sprawling sports complexes and arenas where hatred is the main event. Here, competitive matches, from enhanced gladiatorial combat to digital matches, are used to channel and monetize the population's frustrations. The atmosphere is a volatile mix of righteous unity and fervent rage, with rival teams and fan bases fueling a constant, boiling-over conflict that is manipulated for entertainment and social control.  

9.  **Kama Strip**   
    **- District Type: Nightlife**  
    **- Vice: Lust**  
    **- Description**: A dazzling, neon-drenched urban sprawl that never sleeps. The Strip is the heart of the city's nightlife and entertainment. It is a place where every desire, from the sensual to the forbidden, is a commodity. The air is thick with the scent of synthetic perfumes and the thrum of bass from underground clubs. Here, lust and addiction are not just a sin but an industry, and the populace is encouraged to indulge in fleeting pleasures, no matter the cost.  

10. **Bhaya Compound**  
    **- District Type: Prison**  
    **- Vice: Fear**  
    **- Description**: The city's sprawling prison system, a monument to psychological terror. The Compound is a fortress of surveillance and despair where fear is the primary tool of control. It's a place where the line between reality and illusion is constantly blurred, and where prisoners are subjected to psychological torment to break their will. This district is a chilling manifestation of corrupted power to instill absolute fear and control over his subjects.

## Svarga: The Divine Realm

Svarga is the celestial realm, but it's not a paradise of clouds and gold. It's the highest tier of the cosmic megastructure, a breathtaking city built from solidified light and advanced technology. It's a place of impossible geometries, floating islands of data, and perpetual twilight from a manufactured sun. From its heights, Svarga looks less like a city and more like an unfolding mandala of light—an architecture of eternity.

Life here is lived on a different plane of existence. The air hums with the flow of information, and the sky itself is a vast, ever-changing display of cosmic events. It is a world of order and abundance, where the divine beings and chosen souls reside, constantly managing and observing the mortal realms. It is the core operating system of the cosmos, the ultimate nexus of power, knowledge, and fate.

**The zones of Svarga:**

1.  **Sudharma: The Seat of Governance**

This is the supreme command center of the celestial realm, where the guardians monitor and maintain cosmic order. It’s not just a building; it’s a massive, multi-tiered structure of solidified light and nanite-infused marble, suspended in the upper atmosphere of Svarga.

* **The Akasha Halls:** These are the personal havens for each guardian. Each hall is a private, consciousness-connected space where a guardian can retreat from the shared reality of Svarga. Within their respective halls, the guardians can access and process their vast, individual streams of cosmic data. The rooms are more like complex neural networks than physical spaces, filled with holographic projections of star maps, planetary schematics, and the intricate histories of their designated directions. The Akasha Halls are a place for solitude and the absorption of a universe of information.

* **The Sabha:** The grand assembly hall and debate chamber of the guardians. Unlike the private Akasha Halls, the Sabha is designed for collective action. It's a vast, circular amphitheater dominated by a central, constantly shifting holographic projection of the cosmos. The guardians' seats are elevated, each one at a cardinal direction, allowing them to project their insights and data streams into the central display. This is where they hold court, analyze threats, and make the critical decisions that govern all existence, with the fate of realms hanging in the balance of their debates.

2.  **Nandana Gardens: Oracles Residence**

This is a living data-grove where the oracles of time reside, their prophetic visions and historical insights intertwined with the digital flora and fauna of the Gardens. The "plants" are bioluminescent data servers, the "waterfalls" are streams of pure information, and the air hums with forgotten whispers and future possibilities.

* **Lair of Days Past (Narada):** This is a complex, tangled labyrinth of forgotten information. It’s a vast digital ruin where old data and fragmented histories are stored. The Lair is filled with glitching holographic ghosts of events long past, and its data streams are thick with the static of lost memories. Narada resides here, sifting through the chaos to find patterns and hidden truths, his every move a step through a non-linear archive of all that has been.

* **Presence Sanctum (Durga):** A place of pure, instantaneous clarity. The Sanctum is a clean, crystalline fortress protected by powerful energy shields. Its atmosphere is one of constant, active vigilance, with live data streams from all over the universe projected on every surface. Durga's insights are not passive; they are a constant, real-time analysis of the present moment, allowing her to detect threats and imbalances as soon as they arise.

* **Tomorrows' Hive (Kalki):** This is a place of beautiful and terrifying chaos. The Hive is a constantly shifting, interconnected web of light and pure probability. Threads of possible futures buzz and collide around the central point, forming a complex matrix of potential destinies. Kalki resides here not to predict a single outcome, but to understand the flow of all possible tomorrows, prepared to act when one of them becomes dominant.

3.  **The Tri~Core: Trimurti Abode**

This is the highest point in Svarga, a hyper-technological nexus of creation, preservation, and destruction. It is the fundamental operating system of the cosmos, accessible only by the three primary deities.

* **The Dawn~Core (Brahma):** The ultimate creative engine. This Core is a celestial forge where raw data and abstract concepts are forged into the blueprints for new realities. Its atmosphere is filled with silent energy and the sound of pure code being written into existence. It's a place of limitless potential, where the very first moments of a new universe are designed.

* **The Noon~Core (Vishnu):** The heart of stability and continuity. This Core is a vast, serene library of all existence. Every law of physics, every historical event, every living being’s journey is recorded and preserved within its endless data streams. This is the source of all cosmic order and harmony, where Vishnu maintains the balance and ensures the universe's ongoing operation.

* **The Dusk~Core (Shiva):** The ultimate agent of change. The Dusk~Core is a powerful reactor of controlled dissolution. Old realities and defunct universes are fed into its core, where they are broken down and purified in a torrent of energy. It is not a place of mindless destruction but a necessary cycle of transformation, ensuring that the old gives way to the new so that creation can begin again.

## The Plexus: The Interdimensional Network

The Plexus exists as a vast neural network connecting the mortal and divine realms, functioning as both communication medium and transportation infrastructure for cosmic governance. This interdimensional space appears as an endless web of luminous pathways that pulse with the flow of information, souls, and divine presence between realities. Unlike physical space, The Plexus operates on principles of connection and intent rather than distance, allowing instantaneous transmission of prayers, governance proposals, and voting data across cosmic boundaries.

Three primary functions define The Plexus's role in the cosmic system. First, it serves as the passage through which deceased souls transition from mortal existence to divine judgment and their eventual destinations in the afterlife. Second, all forms of spiritual communication—from individual prayers to collective governance signals—travel through these neural pathways to reach their intended divine recipients. Finally, The Plexus enables the Guardians and other divine entities to move between their domains and the mortal realm at light speed, bypassing the constraints of physical travel. This makes The Plexus both the nervous system of cosmic democracy and the highway system of divine intervention, ensuring that the relationship between mortal and divine realms remains dynamic and responsive.

**Known Entities of the Plexus**

1. **The Plexus Archive**

The vast flows of energy and information traversing The Plexus are not ephemeral; they are perpetually and immutably recorded within a hidden structure known as **The Plexus Archive**. This repository is conceptualized as an auxiliary neural network within The Plexus itself, storing the total sum of all interdimensional dialogue.

The Archive’s function is singular and absolute: to store every interaction, every signal, and every data point passed between the mortal realm and the divine. Critically, **The Plexus Archive is inaccessible** to all entities—neither mortal petitioners, nor the Guardians, nor the highest divine authorities can directly access, modify, or audit its contents. This insulation ensures the Archive remains a perfectly neutral, complete, and unalterable record of cosmic history.

2. **The Archivist**

The sole entity tasked with the stewardship of this universal ledger is **The Archivist**. Little is known of this figure beyond their singular, ceaseless mandate to observe and curate the totality of existence stored within The Plexus Archive. The Archivist is responsible for the collection and permanent indexing of all recorded moments, including the fragmentary micro-stories designated as "Shards."

While the Archive remains sealed, some of these collected Shards occasionally **"leak"** through The Plexus's computational boundaries and into our realm. These are exposed through the use of **blockchain technology**, where the core narrative content of the Shard is openly published, and the corresponding **Meta-Narrative Logs** (Echo Source, time stamps, and the Archivist's own commentary) are immutably recorded as transaction events. This mechanism is the only known way to interact with the Archive's contents.
