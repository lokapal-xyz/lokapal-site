> Glimpses of the Fealty universe, transmitted through the interdimensional network

The Plexus connects all realms—a vast neural web where thoughts, souls, and signals travel between the mortal cities and divine domains. As data flows through this mystical infrastructure, fragments of life scatter across its pathways like light through a prism.

These are the **shards** we've captured: brief transmissions from Lanka Prime's ten districts, where millions of citizens navigate their daily existence under cosmic governance. Each piece offers a window into lives both extraordinary and familiar—the struggles, dreams, and quiet moments that define humanity in the shadow of the divine.

Welcome to the gateway between worlds, where every story is a signal waiting to be revealed.

> New shards are captured and decoded regularly. Each revelation brings us closer to understanding the intricate tapestry of the Fealty universe.

## Shard 1: Lighting a cigar

It's around ten o' clock. 

This train stinks, and today was a double-shift: a recycling gig near the Buddhi Hub this morning, followed by my usual assistant job at the Lobha Exchange. I'm exhausted and hungry, but it's a half-hour commute back to my house, so my stomach and back will have to wait.

Sometimes I envy my brother. He works at the Foundries on a fixed weekly schedule, and the pay is good. He's missing three bio-fingers, but the nano-implants were covered by the insurance. Funny enough, my boss at the Exchange is an investor in that company, and he always complains that the workers fake their injuries to resell the implants. 

Some do that, of course. I saw some discarded toes this morning while recycling. They were full of blood — no longer good for the Buddhi geeks. I recovered so little nano it wasn't even worth it. At least when I get back home I can light up one of the cigars I snatched from my boss's desk. Suck it, chump! That's for thinking all workers are scammers. My brother is the honest one in the family. 

That's the circle of life in Lanka Prime. From bones to steel — and then, to the trash... 

It's five past ten. I'm hungry.
