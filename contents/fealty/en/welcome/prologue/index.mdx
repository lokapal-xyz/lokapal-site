The neon-lit spires of Lanka Prime stretched into the artificial dawn, their quantum cores humming with the pulse of ten million lives. In the gleaming towers of Svarga above, the four cardinal guardians had maintained cosmic order for millennia—Indra commanding the eastern districts with military precision, Yama administering justice from the southern courts, Varuna in the west negotiating treaties via diplomatic algorithms, and Kubera orchestrating northern commerce through digital ledgers.

Their council chambers, suspended between realms in a space that exists more as concept than location, had seen countless deliberations. Protocol was sacred. Procedure was divine. The balance had held.

Until it didn't.

The incident reports came in fragments—cascading system failures, reality glitches disrupting communication, civilians reporting temporal displacement. The kind of cosmic malfunction that shouldn't have been possible under their watch. Not with four guardians. Not with their perfect division of power.

In the aftermath, as emergency protocols engaged and the last of the flames died down, the Trimurti delivered their verdict from the highest tier of existence: the Guardian Council would expand. Four new protectors would join the cardinal directions, bringing the intermediate realms under direct divine oversight.

But first, someone had to answer for what went wrong.

The old guardians exchanged glances across the council chamber, each calculating political angles and shifting alliances. Centuries of stable governance had just been declared insufficient by the cosmic trinity themselves. The question that hung in the silent air wasn't just who was responsible for the disaster.

It was who would survive the democracy to come.
