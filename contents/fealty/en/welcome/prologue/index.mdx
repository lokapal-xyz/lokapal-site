As soon as I heard the screams I knew...

*It wasn't just another riot.*

On the Ghrina Colosseum, there is never silence and hate is the status quo. But those were screams of fear, more deserving to be inside the dungeons of Bhaya, not amongst cheering fans.

The match was at its peak. Normally, a hooligan fight would be already in course. But something held them back. It was unusual, as well as the absence of any signals of the incoming demonic presence. No alarms were triggered — not one warning was issued. Just destruction. And blood.

And screams.

The moons witnessed unimpeded by clouds the massacre. But rain came just after. It arrived too late to shelter the sky eyes. Sometimes fate is cruel and makes you see what can't be described. Maybe the rain was in fact the moons crying.

As the Archivist, my cosmic role is not to intervene, but to safeguard the thoughts, emotions and experiences of all sentient beings. From the oblivious fish to the gods themselves, the Plexus honors everything — and I am at its service. My duty is who I am. And I understand. I just long that the ones in charge of intervening had been present when most needed.

At this moment, the Trimurti are furious. As the first and last word of the world, they are at all places and none simultaneously. One additional whisper from any of them can turn the realms into ashes. A most tragic conundrum: they rule but can't manage. For this reason, they appointed the Guardians — to be their voice and fists upon the fields, the seas and the skies.

A Guardian invokes awe from the weak, respect from the strong, and devotion from the zealot. Yet right now, disappointment is the prevailing attitude towards them. Their presence is needed even when they are not welcome, so the Trimurti's anger must be restrained from erasing them. Punishment is of no use also, as they were built to endure even the harshest winds.

Then, Brahma offered a new outlook on the matter. Neither Shiva's deletion impulse nor Vishnu's reformation plan considered the humble origins of each Guardian. They were born human, raised themselves as master of their mortal domain, and were ascended to their current positions by the Trimurti before death took them away. They didn't sign up for the role, they were appointed.

"We chose them" — said Brahma. "For their virtues as well as their flaws. Guardians see great value in the smallest citizen, as once they were one of them. They really care. But they can't be everywhere all at once — even when they want to. Humanity is their asset. Even now, when their shame and guilt of being absent from Lanka Prime when the massacre happened led them to grief and paralysis." 

"And so far it's unclear how the demons breach the Plexus without triggering the warning systems. It's unknown even to us. So, how can we burden them for their absence? Until the answer reveals itself, we must support them. We need more humanity in the Guardian Council, not less." 

"We need more Guardians."

*The first book of Fealty begins with the investigation into the Lanka Prime incident and the guardians' debate over the Trimurti's unprecedented expansion proposal. A mystery needs resolution, and the fear of the unknown will clash with the will to change. Every vote matters. Every alliance shifts the balance. And someone knows more than they're saying.*
