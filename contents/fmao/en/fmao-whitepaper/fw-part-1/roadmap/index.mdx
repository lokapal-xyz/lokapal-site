## Objectives 

The roadmap for *From Many, as One* follows a deliberate three-phase progression—from laying foundations, to engaging audiences, to gradually allowing shared governance. Each phase builds on the previous, ensuring stability, narrative integrity, and long-term sustainability.

## Phase 1: Foundations *(Completed)*

This initial phase focused on experimentation and infrastructure.  
Key accomplishments include:
- Exploring different storytelling formats to identify those best suited for the project's tone and goals.
- Developing character archetypes capable of supporting prolonged narrative development.
- Designing a Web3 framework that serves both governance mechanics and lore requirements.
- Planning a sustainable structure that begins under centralized direction and could later allow community governance.

## Phase 2: Engagement and Publishing *(Current)*

With the core vision and technical groundwork in place, the focus has shifted to visibility, audience building, and content delivery.  
Active priorities:
- Launching a website that connects readers to all components of From Many, as One.
- Developing *From the Plexus* as the main pre-launch content strategy.
- Promoting the project in both Web3-native and mainstream cultural spaces.
- Building an active social presence to foster conversation and anticipation.
- Integrating From Many, as One into the Lokapal ecosystem for educational, research, and public debate purposes.
- Deploying the From Many, as One Web3 infrastructure.
- Establishing sustainable funding channels to support ongoing operations.

## Phase 3: Growth and Expansion *(Planned)*

This phase will guide From Many, as One into a potential community-driven future, while protecting the integrity of its story and governance design.  
Planned actions:
- Allowing direct governance participation in controlled stages to readers with blockchain knowledge.
- Opening opportunities for lore contributions via contests, guest writing, and partnerships.
- Maintaining alignment between governance decisions, narrative coherence, and the From Many, as One universe.

Long-term sustainability will come from a hybrid model of cultural patronage (Patreon, NFTs and collectibles), community support (grants, memberships, and partnerships), and integration into broader Web3 initiatives—ensuring that From Many, as One can grow without sacrificing narrative coherence or governance integrity.
