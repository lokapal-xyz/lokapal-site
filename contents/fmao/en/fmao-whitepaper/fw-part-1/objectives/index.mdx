## Narrative: Political Fantasy as Governance Framework
- **Explore distributed authority through character conflict.** Present governance dilemmas and coordination challenges through divine beings forced to share power despite philosophical disagreement.
- **Make abstract concepts tangible.** Use political intrigue and character relationships to examine how decentralized systems function when participants have competing interests.
- **Build accessible entry to complex themes.** Deliver governance philosophy through compelling storytelling rather than academic analysis.

---

## Technical: Blockchain as Narrative Infrastructure
- **Demonstrate creative blockchain applications.** Show how decentralized infrastructure can serve narrative purposes—permanent records, verifiable canon, transparent decision-making—without requiring reader participation in crypto mechanics.
- **Create verifiable worldbuilding.** Use on-chain records to make story elements and community sentiment permanently canonical and auditable.
- **Explore infrastructure as storytelling medium.** Treat blockchain not only as governance mechanism but as the technical implementation of fictional systems (The Plexus) that connect story world to reader reality.

## Community: Sentiment as Worldbuilding Data
- **Incorporate community feedback into canon.** Track reader sentiment about characters and factions, making popular support a measurable element of the fictional universe.
- **Enable progressive engagement.** Allow readers to choose their participation level—from passive consumption to active community discussion to optional exploration of technical implementation.
- **Build transparent creative process.** Record story decisions and community influence on-chain, creating auditable history of how reader sentiment shaped worldbuilding without claiming readers govern plot outcomes.
