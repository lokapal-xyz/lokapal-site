**From Many, as One** uses ERC-1155 book tokens as community support tokens. Each book in the series has its own token that readers can mint to support the project.

## What Are Book Tokens?

- **Unlimited Supply**: These are support tokens, not artificially scarce collectibles
- **Fixed Price**: 0.002 ETH per token (naturally fluctuates with ETH price)
- **Permanent Record**: All mints are recorded on Base Mainnet
- **No Utility Beyond Support**: These tokens don't gate content or provide special access—they're a way to support the project
