*A Story from the Kama Strip*

## Meeting One

The room smells like recycled air and cheap coffee.

Leila counts ten people sitting in the circle, plus the coordinator. Eleven total. She takes the empty chair between a woman in her forties and a younger man who won't make eye contact with anyone.

"Welcome, everyone," the coordinator says. His name is Stefan — he introduced himself when Leila arrived twenty minutes early, too anxious to wait outside. He's maybe fifty, with kind eyes and the sort of calm presence that makes you want to trust him. "We have a new member joining us today. Leila, would you like to introduce yourself?"

Leila's throat tightens. "I'm Leila. I'm twenty-eight. I've been... struggling with compulsive sexual behavior for about three years. It's cost me my last job, most of my savings, and my relationship with my family."

"Thank you for sharing that, Leila. That took courage." Stefan's voice is warm, nonjudgmental. "Does anyone else want to check in?"

The woman next to Leila raises her hand. "I'm Amara. Five years dealing with this. I came tonight because I almost relapsed yesterday. Walked past one of the clubs on Rati Avenue and felt that pull, you know? Like my body was making decisions before my brain could catch up."

Heads nod around the circle. Leila recognizes that pull — the way desire stops being something you feel and becomes something that controls you. How many times had she promised herself she'd stop, only to find herself back in the Strip at 2 am, spending money she didn't have on experiences she didn't even enjoy anymore?

"The district is designed to do that," Stefan says gently. "Kama Strip isn't just offering services — it's engineering dependency. The algorithms that track your preferences, the way the advertisements follow you home, the economic incentives that keep you coming back. You're not weak for struggling. You're fighting against a system that profits from your vulnerability."

Something loosens in Leila's chest. She's been telling herself for months that she's broken, that something is fundamentally wrong with her. But hearing Stefan frame it as a systemic problem, not a personal failure — it helps.

A man across the circle speaks. "I lost my apartment last month. Spent the rent money on a weekend at one of the experience hotels. My landlord evicted me, and I'm staying with my sister now. She doesn't know why I got evicted. I told her the building was sold."

"Thank you for sharing that," Stefan says. "The financial exploitation is real. Kama targets people who are vulnerable, who are searching for connection or escape — or validation. It sells those things at a price that keeps you coming back, keeps you dependent. But you're here now. That's what matters. You're choosing recovery."

The meeting continues. More stories. More confessions about money spent, relationships destroyed, jobs lost. Leila listens to each one and recognizes herself — the shame, the compulsion, the sense of being trapped in patterns she couldn't break.

When the meeting ends, Stefan catches her before she leaves.

"How are you feeling?"

"Overwhelmed. But... less alone, I think."

"That's the most important thing. Recovery isn't about willpower or shame. It's about community, about understanding that you're fighting something bigger than yourself. Come back next week. It gets easier."

Leila nods. For the first time in months, she feels something like hope.

## Meeting Two

There are eight people in the circle.

Leila notices immediately — the young man who wouldn't make eye contact is gone. So is one of the older woman who'd talked about her marriage falling apart.

Stefan begins the meeting the same way. "Let's check in. How is everyone doing this week?"

Amara goes first. "Better. I didn't go near Rati Avenue. Took a different route home from work, even though it adds twenty minutes. But I needed the distance."

"That's excellent boundary-setting," Stefan says. "Physical distance is important when you're rebuilding your relationship with the district."

Others share their weeks — small victories, near-relapses, ongoing struggles. Leila talks about how she deleted all the apps from her phone, how the absence of notifications felt like withdrawal at first but now feels like relief.

"You're doing important work," Stefan tells her. "Every day you choose recovery is a victory. Don't diminish that."

After the meeting, Leila lingers while others file out. Stefan is collecting the folding chairs, stacking them against the wall.

"Can I ask something?" Leila says.

"Of course."

"There were fewer people tonight. Do people just... stop coming?"

Stefan pauses, holding a chair. "Recovery isn't linear. Sometimes people need to step away and try on their own. Sometimes they find other support systems. Sometimes they relapse and feel too ashamed to come back. We don't track attendance — this is a voluntary program. People come when they need to."

"Right. That makes sense."

But as Leila walks home through the neon-lit streets — the holographic advertisements that pulse with promised pleasure, the clubs that never close, the whole infrastructure of desire made visible — she wonders how many in recovery actually manage to stay away.

## Meeting Three

Five people.

Leila, Amara, two men she recognizes from the first meeting, and one new person — a woman in her thirties who looks like she hasn't slept in days.

Half the original group is gone.

The meeting follows the same format. Check-ins, shared struggles, Stefan's reassuring commentary about how they're fighting against a predatory system, not their own weakness.

But Leila can't focus. She keeps looking at the empty chairs, counting the absent people. Where did they go?

When the meeting ends, she approaches Stefan again.

"The people who stopped coming," she says. "Are they okay?"

Stefan smiles. "I appreciate your concern for the group. It shows you're building community bonds. But I can't discuss other members' situations — confidentiality, you understand. What I can tell you is that some people graduate from the program when they're ready to move forward."

"Graduate?"

"Yes. They've done the work, built the foundation, and they're ready for the next phase of their recovery. It's actually quite positive."

"Oh." Leila feels foolish for worrying. "That's good then."

"It is. And you're making excellent progress yourself. I've been impressed by your commitment these past few weeks."

The praise feels good. Leila hasn't felt competent at anything in months. The addiction had stripped away her sense of self, her confidence, her ability to trust her own decisions. Stefan's validation — his recognition that she's doing well — fills a need she didn't realize was so acute.

"Thank you," she says. "That means a lot."

"Keep coming," Stefan says. "You're exactly where you need to be."

## The Phone Rings

Leila receives a message from Stefan two days before the next scheduled meeting.

*Hi Leila. Could you come to the meeting space an hour early this week? I'd like to talk with you privately about your progress. I think you might be ready to graduate the program. —Stefan*

Leila reads the message three times.

Graduate. The word carries weight — accomplishment, completion, recognition that she's done the work and succeeded where she'd failed so many times before.

---

## Meeting Four

She arrives at 6 pm, an hour before the meeting usually starts. The building is quiet — a converted community center in one of Kama Strip's less commercial zones, sandwiched between residential towers and a transit station.

The meeting room door is unlocked. Leila pushes it open.

The circle of chairs is gone. The room is empty except for Stefan, sitting in one of the plastic chairs against the wall.

"Leila. Thank you for coming early." He stands, smiling. "Please, sit."

She takes the chair next to him. The room feels different without the circle, without the other people. More intimate. Less safe, though she's not sure why that thought occurs to her.

"I wanted to talk with you about the next phase of your recovery," Stefan begins. "You've made remarkable progress in just a few weeks. You've shown real commitment to change, real willingness to examine your patterns. That's rare."

"Thank you."

"Most people who struggle with compulsive behavior never get to the point where you are now. They stay trapped in cycles of shame and relapse. But you've broken through that. You've done the foundational work."

Leila feels pride swelling in her chest. She has worked hard. She has stayed away from the Strip's temptations, deleted the apps, changed her routines. She's been good.

"So I want to invite you to something special," Stefan continues. "A more advanced group for people who are ready to transcend their addiction entirely."

"Transcend?"

"Yes. Most recovery programs focus on restraint — on avoiding triggers, managing urges, white-knuckling your way through temptation. But there's another path. A path that doesn't require you to spend your whole life fighting against your own desires. A path of spiritual integration, where you learn to transmute those energies into something higher."

The words sound reasonable, but something in Leila's stomach tightens.

"What kind of group?"

"A community of people who have moved beyond shame and repression. Who understand that sexuality isn't something to be controlled, but something to be channeled toward spiritual awakening. We meet in a more private setting — a retreat space outside the main district. Very selective membership. By invitation only."

"Why can't we do that here?"

"The work we do requires privacy, discretion. It's not for everyone. Most people aren't ready for that level of transformation. But I think you are. You have a capacity for surrender."

Stefan leans forward slightly. His eyes are still kind, still warm. But there's something else there now — something Leila can't quite name. She stands up.

"I need to think about it."

"Of course." Stefan stands too. "Take your time."

He hands her a small card — matte black, with gold lettering. An address in the outer zones of the Strip.

"If you're interested in graduating, come to this address. Bring nothing. Just yourself and your willingness to transform."

Leila takes the card. Her hand is shaking.

"Think about it," Stefan says again. "You've come so far. Don't stop now when you're on the edge of real breakthrough."

---

Leila walks home through streets that feel simultaneously too bright and too dark. The neon signs pulse around her — promises of pleasure, connection, escape. The same promises that had consumed her savings, destroyed her relationships, left her feeling hollow and ashamed.

The same promises Stefan just made, dressed in different language.

*Spiritual transcendence. Guided experiences. Selective community.*

She pulls out her phone and searches the address on the black card. It's a residence building in one of Kama's "luxury discretion" zones — the places where wealthy people go for experiences they don't want on their credit histories.

She thinks about the ten people in the first meeting. Then eight. Then five. Then just her, sitting in an empty room with a man offering her the "next level" of recovery.

*You have a capacity for surrender.*

The words replay in her mind. Not "strength" or "resilience" or any of the qualities you'd want in someone recovering from addiction.

Surrender.

Opening yourself.

Guided experiences.

Her phone buzzes. A message from Stefan.

*I forgot to mention — the retreat includes accommodations and meals. Everything provided. You won't need to worry about anything except your own growth. I really hope you'll consider it. You're so close to freedom.*

Leila stares at the message.

Then she blocks his number.
