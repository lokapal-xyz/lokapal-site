The notification hits my retinal display at 6:47 AM.

"CONGRATULATIONS! Your BioCredit score has increased by 0.3 points!"

I'm standing in the Moha Citadel commons, watching the holographic sunrise cycle through its third loop tonight. Can't sleep. Haven't been able to since they updated the community happiness algorithm last month. Now it tracks our emotional responses in real-time, adjusting the ambient temperature, the sunset colors, even the birdsong frequencies to keep us "optimally content".

My neighbor, Mrs. Chen, she bought the full integration package. Now her apartment almost hugs her when she comes home stressed. Last week I saw her crying in the hallway, but her biometrics showed "elevated joy levels," so the system scheduled her for a community appreciation ceremony.

I miss when sadness was just sadness. When you could feel bad without seventeen AI wellness coaches offering meditation subscriptions. My daughter doesn't even remember what real grass looked like. She thinks the synthetic stuff in our courtyard is "more authentic" because it never dies.

The sunrise loops again. Still two hours until my shift at the data center.

The algorithm knows I'm not sleeping. It's already adjusting tomorrow's sunset to be "extra soothing".
