*A Story from the Lobha Exchange*

---

I made my first million by the time I was **twenty-three**.

Not through inheritance or luck — through understanding something that most traders in the Lobha Exchange never grasp: the market isn't about predicting the future. It's about understanding that everyone else is trying to predict tomorrow, and being one step ahead of their predictions.

Traders aren't the only ones confused. My parents also misunderstood their future. They died poor at forty-two and forty-four, respectively — father from untreated diabetes, mother from a heart condition she ignored until it was too late. They'd spent their modest incomes on experiences, on living in the moment, on enjoying their youth. They'd always assumed there'd be time later to worry about savings, about health, about planning for a future that never came.

I learned from their mistake.

I started as a junior analyst at Daksha Capital, processing agricultural futures data from the outlying sectors. Boring work, the kind that made most analysts quit within a year. But I saw patterns in the data that no one else notice.

By **twenty-five**, I was running my own division. By **thirty**, I'd left to start my own firm. By **thirty-five**, Vora Capital Management was handling eight billion in assets.

How did that happen? No secrets: I worked while other people slept. I analyzed while they socialized.

Time was the real currency, and I spent mine better than anyone else in Lobha.

The first procedure was practically spontaneous.

I was **forty-two** — the same age my father had been when he died — and my body was starting to betray me in small ways. Slower recovery from eighteen-hour days. Difficulty maintaining focus during critical evening trading sessions. A persistent fatigue that no amount of stimulants could fully address.

Dr. Okafor's clinic was in the Lobha's medical complex, tucked between the investment banks and the data centers. Very discreet. Very exclusive. The kind of place where you paid in sigilcurrency and no one asked questions about your medical history.

"Cellular regeneration therapy," she explained, pulling up my genetic profile on a holographic display. "We'll target the degraded telomeres, enhance mitochondrial function, optimize your neural chemistry. You'll feel like you're thirty again."

"How long does it last?"

"Depends on your lifestyle and maintenance regimen. With quarterly top-ups, you could maintain peak performance for another forty, fifty years easily."

Fifty years. I did the math automatically — fifty years of trading at my current pace, with compound returns averaging 23% annually...

"When can we start?"

The procedure took six weeks. When I emerged, I felt extraordinary. Not just younger, but better than I'd ever been. My reaction times were faster, my pattern recognition sharper, my endurance limitless.

I restructured my entire operation around the medical enhancement.

The returns were incredible. Vora Capital's assets under management hit fifty billion within three years.

I was **sixty-seven** years old. I looked and felt thirty-five.

And on top of that, I'd have time to do all those things I'd been postponing.

Travel. Relationships. Art. Literature. All those human experiences that people wasted their youth on instead of building something meaningful.

I'd do those things later. After I hit a hundred billion. After I'd established a legacy that would outlast me.

Just a few more years.

By **ninety-three**, I needed more aggressive interventions.

The regeneration therapy had plateaued. Dr. Okafor — herself enhanced to the point where she looked barely forty despite being eighty — recommended full system optimization. Organ printing, neural augmentation, skeletal reinforcement. The procedures took four months and cost more than most people in Lanka Prime would earn in five lifetimes.

But I'd made seven billion in the last quarter alone.

When I returned to work, I was better than I'd ever been. I installed neural interfaces that let me process market data directly. I hired a live-in staff to handle everything non-essential. Every minute not spent on trading was waste.

Vora Capital hit two hundred billion. Then five hundred billion.

I was **a hundred and thirty-eight** years old, and I still looked forty-five.

The things I'd planned to do later—they could wait. 

I had time. Decades of time.

---

By **a hundred and seventy-one**, the protocols weren't about enhancement anymore.

They were about preservation.

My body was breaking down despite decades of cutting-edge regeneration therapy. Dr. Okafor's granddaughter was blunt about my options. Life support integration. Consciousness preservation protocols. Full-body system management. Ongoing procedures. Full-time medical supervision.

And costs that were staggering even by Lobha standards.

But Vora Capital was approaching a trillion. I'd invested heavily in life-extension technology firms. I could afford anything.

What I couldn't afford was to stop.

The door chime sounds.

It's the nurse. It's always the nurse now — every eight hours, precisely on schedule, because my body can't regulate itself anymore.

I want to get up and answer the door. But I can't.

My legs were amputated five years ago when the necrosis became too aggressive to treat. Then my arms, one by one, as the tissue rejection spread despite the immunosuppressants. Now I'm just a torso and a head in a medical pod, kept alive by machines I can't even see from this position.

The nurse enters with her tablet, her professional smile already in place. She's young — maybe thirty, maybe enhanced to look thirty. Her job is to keep me alive for another eight hours.

"How are we feeling today, Mr. Vora?"

I can't speak — the ventilator handles my breathing now — but the neural interface transmits my response to her tablet.

"SAME AS YESTERDAY."

I'm **two hundred and four** years old.

She begins her routine: checking vitals, adjusting medication drips, monitoring the twelve systems keeping my remaining organs functional.

It costs me eight hundred million a year to maintain the medical systems keeping me alive. Not enhanced. Not optimized. Not even really living.

Just not dying.

The nurse finishes her checks. Before she leaves, I transmit another message to her tablet.

"THERE'S A PUBLIC CEMETERY IN SECTOR 11. NORTHSIDE MEMORIAL. MY PARENTS ARE BURIED THERE."

She pauses, confused by the non-sequitur.

"I WANT TO ARRANGE MY PLOT THERE. NEXT TO THEM. FOR WHEN THE TIME COMES. CAN YOU CONTACT THE ADMINISTRATION?"

"You... want a public cemetery?" Her confusion is evident. "Mr. Vora, with your resources, you could have a private memorial. Even a mausoleum district. Something befitting—"

"NORTHSIDE MEMORIAL. SECTOR 11. NEXT TO PLOTS 247 AND 248."

She makes a note on her tablet, still uncertain. "Of course. I'll make the arrangements."

After she leaves, I lie in the quiet, watching the financial and medical displays. I think about my mom and my dad...

Just a few more years.
