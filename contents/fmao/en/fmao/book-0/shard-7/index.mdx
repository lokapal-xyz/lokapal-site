*A Story from the Krodha Foundries*

The doorbell rings.

Maya opens the door expecting a neighbor, maybe a delivery drone that needs a signature. Instead, she finds Jade standing in the rain, soaked through, his clothes clinging to his frame.

He's crying.

"Jade? Why didn't you use your—" She stops. He doesn't have his keys. He doesn't have his tool bag either, the worn canvas sack he always carries to job sites. He's just standing there in the downpour, water running down his face mixing with tears.

"I'm sorry," he says, his voice breaking. "I'm so sorry, honey. I'm so sorry."

"Come inside, you're—"

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." He can't seem to say anything else. His hands are shaking.

Maya pulls him across the threshold. Water pools on their apartment floor. She closes the door against the rain and turns to him, taking his face in her hands.

"Jade. Look at me. What happened?"

He tries to speak, but it comes out as a sob. She's never seen him like this. In eight years together, through all the hardships, all the struggles, she's never seen him break down this completely.

"Take a breath," she says gently. "Just breathe. Whatever it is, we'll figure it out."

He does. One shaking breath, then another. His eyes meet hers.

"I killed someone."

The words hang in the air between them. The rain hammers against their window.

"What?"

"At the foundry. The job site on Sector 12. I killed the manager. I didn't mean to — I mean, I did, but I didn't want to, I tried so hard not to—" His voice fractures again.

Maya's hands are still on his face. She doesn't pull away.

"Tell me what happened."

"He kept calling me stupid." Jade's voice is hollow now, like he's reciting from a script he's memorized. "All morning. 'Move that faster, stupid.' 'Check the measurements, stupid.' 'Even a child could do this better than you, stupid.' I was handling it, Maya. I swear I was handling it. I counted to ten, I breathed, I did everything you taught me."

She knows. She knows how hard he tries. How many times he's swallowed his rage, walked away from fights, taken insults without responding. How desperately he's tried to be someone different than who the world told him he was.

"But then he said—" Jade's voice cracks. "He said, 'If you're this dumb, imagine how stupid your wife must be to stay with you.'"

Maya closes her eyes.

"I didn't think," Jade continues. "I just... there was a sledgehammer right there, and I picked it up, and I hit him. I kept hitting him. I couldn't stop. By the time I realized what I was doing, he wasn't moving anymore. There was so much blood, Maya. So much."

The rain keeps falling. Through their thin walls, they can hear the sounds of the Krodha — the constant mechanical grind of the factories, the hiss of steam vents, the low rumble of machinery that never stops.

"I ran," Jade says. "I left everything — my tools, my keys, everything. I just ran. I didn't know where to go except here. Except you."

Maya pulls him close. He's shaking, his body wracked with silent sobs. She holds him while he breaks apart, while eight years of trying to be better crashes against one moment of violence that undid it all.

She knew this might happen someday. Not that she wanted it to, not that she didn't believe in him. But she understood what the world had done to him. How every teacher who called him slow, every classmate who mocked him, every family member who treated him like he was broken — how all of that had built something inside him that couldn't be reasoned with, only barely contained.

She'd fallen in love with him anyway. Not despite his struggles, but because of how hard he fought against them. Because he tried. Because with her, he was gentle and patient and kind. Because he'd chosen to be better than what the world had labeled him, even when the world kept pushing him back toward violence.

"I love you," she says into his shoulder. "Whatever happens now, I love you."

"I'm sorry," he whispers again. "I'm so sorry."

Through the rain, they hear the sirens.

The police arrive in two vehicles — a patrol car and a transport van. Four officers in armor step out, their faces obscured by visors that glow with targeting data. One of them pounds on the door.

"Jade Sato! Open the door!"

Jade pulls away from Maya. His eyes are red but dry now. He's composed himself into something harder, something resigned.

"I have to—"

"I know."

He opens the door. The lead officer steps forward, hand on his weapon.

"Jade Sato, you're under arrest for the murder of Hector Silva. Step outside with your hands visible."

Jade does. The rain immediately soaks him again as he moves onto the small landing outside their apartment. Maya stands in the doorway, watching.

"Turn around. Hands behind your back."

Jade complies. One officer cuffs him while another produces something from the van — a vest made of dark composite material, lined with what looks like compressed hydraulic cylinders.

"Aggression Restraint System," the officer says, not to Jade but to his partner. "Standard protocol for violent offenders in the Krodha jurisdiction."

They remove Jade's cuffs long enough to strap the vest onto him, then secure his hands again. The vest fits tightly across his chest and back, with the cylinders positioned against his ribcage. A small display panel on the front glows green.

"Sensors monitor heart rate, adrenaline levels, muscle tension, and movement patterns," the officer explains, still not looking at Jade. "If it detects aggressive behavior or intent to harm, the restraint system activates. Hydraulic compression collapses the chest cavity. Death is instantaneous."

Maya's breath catches. "You can't—"

"It's standard procedure, ma'am. For the safety of officers and civilians during transport of violent criminals."

Jade turns his head slightly. "It's okay, Maya. I'm not going to fight. I'm not going to give them a reason."

The lead officer gestures to the others. "Check the apartment. Make sure there are no other suspects or weapons."

"Wait," Jade says. "You don't need to go in there. It's just my wife. She wasn't involved. She doesn't know anything."

The officer ignores him. Two of them move toward the door.

Maya doesn't step aside fast enough. One of them places a hand on her shoulder and pushes her to the side — not violently, but firmly. She stumbles slightly against the doorframe.

"Don't touch her!"

Jade moves without thinking. His body reacts before his mind can catch up — a surge forward, an instinct to place himself between his wife and any threat. His hands are still cuffed, but his body shifts into a defensive posture, muscles tensing, heart rate spiking.

The vest's display flashes from green to red.

"Jade, no!" Maya's voice.

The hydraulic cylinders activate.

The sound is sharp and mechanical — a pneumatic hiss followed by a wet crunch. The vest compresses inward with tremendous force, collapsing Jade's ribcage like crushed aluminum. His sternum splinters. His ribs break inward. His heart ruptures between compressed bone and hydraulic pressure.

He drops to his knees on the wet landing. Blood pools in his mouth, spills over his lips, mixes with the rain.

He's trying to say something. Maya can see his lips moving. She drops beside him, her hands hovering over him but not touching — afraid that touching will hurt him, though he's already past hurting.

"I'm sorry," she thinks he's saying. "I'm sorry."

Then he's gone. His eyes are still open, but there's nothing behind them. The rain washes the blood from his face almost as fast as it flows.

The officers stand in a loose semicircle, their postures relaxed. The lead officer makes a note on his tablet.

"Restraint system activated. Subject deceased. Time of death—" He checks his device. "9 pm."

Maya is screaming. Or maybe she's not. She can't tell. Everything feels distant, like she's watching this happen to someone else. The officers are talking to her, asking her questions, but the words don't make sense.

One of them is saying something about how the system is designed to protect them, how it's not their fault, how Krodha's violent offenders require special precautions.

Another is apologizing — "Sorry for your loss, ma'am" — while simultaneously asking her to step back so they can process the scene.

They're still going to search the apartment. Even now, with Jade's body still warm on the landing, they're going to do their job, follow their protocols, check for evidence that doesn't exist.

Maya stands. She doesn't step aside this time. She doesn't speak. She just stands in the doorway while the rain falls and her husband's blood pools around her feet.

The officers exchange glances. The lead one sighs.

"Ma'am, we need to—"

"He was protecting me," Maya says. Her voice is steady. Too steady. "He wasn't attacking you. He was protecting me."

"The system doesn't differentiate intent. It responds to aggressive behavioral patterns. If the subject had remained calm—"

"He spent his whole life trying to remain calm." The words come out quiet but sharp. "Every day, people called him stupid. They mocked him. They treated him like he was nothing. And every day, he swallowed it. He walked away. He tried to be better than what they said he was."

The officer says nothing.

The rain keeps falling. Indifferent. Constant. The same rain that falls on the factories and the foundries and the smoke stacks that never stop belching dark clouds into the gray sky.

The same rain that falls on everyone in Krodha, where anger is manufactured as reliably as the steel they forge, where violence is so common they've built systems to contain it, systems that kill people for the crime of being afraid for someone they love.

"We still need to search the apartment," the officer says.

Maya steps aside.

They find nothing, of course. No weapons. No evidence. No other suspects. Just a small home where two people tried to build a life despite the world telling them they didn't deserve one.

When they leave, they take Jade's body with them. Standard procedure. Evidence. Property of the state now.

Maya stands in the doorway and watches the vehicles disappear into the rain.

Then she closes the door.

The apartment is very quiet.

The factories keep running and the foundries keep burning and the rain keeps falling on Krodha, indifferent to everything it touches.
