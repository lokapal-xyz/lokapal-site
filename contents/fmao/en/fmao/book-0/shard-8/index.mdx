*A Story from the Ghrina Colosseum*

---

Cassie stares out the train window at the passing landscape, her jaw clenched so tight it aches.

Three hours. Three hours on this decrepit regional line to some nowhere town called Dharavi because her boss decided — two days before the match — that the Sector 9 property assessment couldn't wait until next week.

"It's just a game," Omar had said, like he hadn't spent the last month listening to her talk about nothing else. The semifinals. Crimson Storm versus the Silver Jackals. The biggest rivalry in combat arena history — to her, at least. A matchup that happens maybe once every five years when both teams are good enough to make it this far.

And she's going to miss it.

She pulls up the ticket on her phone — Section 12, Row 8, Seat 14. She bought it the moment the playoff brackets were announced. Eight thousand credits. Three months' discretionary income. She'd planned her entire weekend around this: the pre-match rally at Jaya Plaza, the procession to the Colosseum, four hours of pure, unfiltered competition and chaos.

Four hours of being surrounded by fifty thousand people who understand. Who feel the same burning loyalty, the same visceral hatred for everything Silver. Who know that Crimson Storm isn't just a team — it's an identity, a family, a tribe that you're born into or choose and then defend with everything you have. And the Ghrina Colosseum is where that loyalty becomes real.

She checks the match time again. 7 pm. She'll still be in Dharavi, measuring property lines for some remote development that Omar's firm is assessing. She'll miss the opening ceremony, the team entrances, the first blood. She'll miss everything.

The train lurches over a rough section of track. Outside, the urban sprawl of Lanka Prime gives way to smaller towns, then rural areas. Rice fields and solar farms and small clusters of buildings that barely qualify as settlements.

Cassie pulls up the Storm fan forums on her tablet. The pre-match thread has eleven thousand comments already — insults about intelligence, about neighborhoods, about family lineage. Threats that hover just on the edge of actionable. The moderators will clean it up eventually, but for now it's pure, unfiltered hatred.

She scrolls through, feeling her blood pressure rise. She types out a response to SilverScum4786, then deletes it. She's supposed to be focusing on work, not getting into forum wars.

But god, she hates them. Hates their smug certainty, their willful ignorance, their inability to admit that their team succeeds through corruption and brutality. Hates that they exist in the same district, breathe the same air, claim to love combat arena when they clearly don't understand what the sport is supposed to mean.

The train conductor announces Dharavi station in ten minutes.

Cassie closes the forum and pulls up her work files. Property assessments. Measurements. Soil composition analysis. The boring machinery of her actual life.

Three hours from now, the match will start without her.

She tries not to think about it.

---

Dharavi is nicer than she expected.

One main street. A few dozen buildings clustered around a central square. Solar panels on every roof, a community garden taking up most of the plaza, children playing some kind of ball game near a fountain that's seen better days.

It's quiet. Peaceful. Cassie hates it immediately.

By 5:30 pm, she's finished. The data is uploaded to the firm's servers. Omar sends a message: *Good work. Head back whenever. See you Monday.*

She checks the train schedule. Next departure to Lanka Prime is at 6:15. She'll be back in the city long after the match ends, but at least she'll be home.

Cassie walks back into town, looking for somewhere to sit that isn't the train platform. She finds a small café on the main street — faded blue awning, hand-painted sign that reads "Haven Café," a few outdoor tables.

Inside, it's cozy. Warm lighting, mismatched furniture, the smell of fresh coffee and something baking. An older man stands behind the counter, maybe sixty, with gray hair and the kind of weathered face that comes from years of hard work.

"Help you?" he asks.

"Coffee. Black. And whatever you're baking."

"Cardamom cookies. Just came out."

"Perfect."

She pays and takes a seat by the window, pulling out her tablet. 5:45 pm. The forums have moved from trash talk to logistics — who's taking which trains, which bars are doing watch parties, what the weather looks like for the outdoor sections.

The man brings her coffee and a plate of cookies. She looks up to thank him and freezes.

She knows that face.

Older now, grayer, with lines around the eyes that weren't there in his champion days. But she knows it.

"You're... you're Finn Okoye."

He smiles, surprised. "Was. Long time ago."

"Was? You're — you were captain. Storm's golden era. Seven championships in twelve years. You're a legend!"

"I'm a café owner now." But he's still smiling, pleased to be recognized. "You follow combat arena?"

"Follow it? I live for it!" The words tumble out. "I've been going to Storm matches since I was seven. My father took me to see you play. You scored the winning point in overtime against Eastern Hawks — I was there. I'll never forget it."

Finn's expression softens. "That was a good match. Long time ago."

"The best match. You were incredible." Cassie feels like she's thirteen again, starstruck and breathless. "I can't believe you're here! I mean, what are you doing in Dharavi?"

"I'm from here originally. Came back after I retired. Quieter than the city."

"But Storm — the team, the Colosseum — don't you miss it?"

"Sometimes. But I got my fill of competition. Twenty years was enough."

Cassie wants to ask a thousand questions, but the first one that comes out is: "Are you watching tonight? The semifinals against Silver?"

Something shifts in his expression. "Don't think so. I don't really follow it anymore."

"But it's Storm versus Silver."

"Yeah, I know." He glances toward the back of the café. "Anyway, enjoy the cookies. Let me know if you need anything else."

He retreats behind the counter before Cassie can press further.

She sits there, confused. How could Finn Okoye not care about Storm versus Silver? How could he just walk away from the team that defined his entire career?

She's halfway through her second cookie when the front door opens.

Another older man enters — tall, lean, with the same weathered quality as Finn. He's carrying a bag of supplies from what looks like the general store across the street.

"Got the sugar you wanted," he calls toward the counter. "And they finally had those—"

He stops when he sees Cassie staring at him.

Because she recognizes him too.

Reza Amari. Silver Jackals. Star player during the same era as Finn. The rivalry within the rivalry — Okoye versus Amari, two of the best players of their generation, constantly matched against each other.

Enemies.

"Miss?" Finn comes out from behind the counter. "This is Reza. My business partner. Reza, this is... sorry, I didn't catch your name."

"Cassie." She can barely get the word out. "Your business partner?"

"Owns half the café," Finn says cheerfully. "Also does most of the baking, despite what I tell customers."

Reza sets down his bag and extends a hand. "Nice to meet you."

Cassie doesn't take it. "You work together?"

"For eight years now," Reza says, lowering his hand. "Started the café together after we both retired."

"But you're... you were Silver."

"I was."

"And he was Storm."

"Still am, technically," Finn says. "Once Storm, always Storm, right? But Reza and I figured out a long time ago that the rivalry was—"

"Important to the sport," Cassie interrupts. Her voice comes out sharper than she intended.

Reza and Finn exchange a glance.

"Is that how they're still framing it?" Reza asks quietly.

"That's how it is!" Cassie can feel her anger rising — anger at this betrayal, at seeing her idol standing next to the enemy like they're friends, like decades of competition meant nothing. "Silver plays dirty. Everyone knows it! The bought refs, the illegal moves, the—"

"Storm wasn't clean either," Finn says gently. "We just had better PR."

The words hit like a slap.

"That's not true."

"It is, actually." Finn pulls out a chair and sits across from her. Reza joins them. "I played for Storm for twenty years. I loved that team. But I also participated in things I'm not proud of. We had relationships with referees. We knew how to work the system. We told ourselves it was justified because Silver did it too, but..."

"We did the same thing," Reza continues. "Told ourselves they were the real villains, that we were just evening the odds. The truth is, both teams played whatever game they needed to win. And the Colosseum encouraged it, because the dirtier the rivalry got, the more people paid to watch."

Cassie shakes her head. "No. I've been going to matches my whole life. I know what I've seen! Silver is—"

"What Ghrina needed us to be," Reza says. "Look, I play the villain. I leaned into it. It was profitable. Storm needed an enemy, and I was happy to play the role. But it was always a role, Cassie. On the arena floor, we hated each other because that's what the sport demanded. Off the floor..."

"We were colleagues," Finn finishes. "We respected each other. We understood what the other was going through better than anyone else could. The pressure, the performance, the constant need to feed the rivalry machine."

"So it was all fake?"

"Not fake," Finn says carefully. "The competition was real. The skill was real. But the hatred — that was cultivated. By the Colosseum, by the media, by the fans themselves. Because hatred sells. Tribal identity sells. The feeling of being part of something bigger than yourself, united against a common enemy — that's powerful. That's profitable."

Cassie thinks about the forums. The death threats. The riots. Her own visceral reaction to seeing Silver fans, to reading their posts, to watching their team succeed.

"We're not judging," Finn says. "I was you. I lived for combat arena, defined myself by it, let it consume every aspect of my identity. And when I retired, I had to figure out who I was without it. Turned out, I didn't know. Because I'd let the team become all of me."

"I came back here," Reza adds. "To Dharavi. Where I grew up. Ran into Finn at the market one day — we're from the same town, grew up three streets apart, though we didn't know each other as kids. We started talking. Realized we'd spent twenty years being enemies when we had more in common than most people in our lives."

"So we started this place," Finn gestures around the café. "Something that was ours, not the Colosseum's. Something that helped the community instead of feeding off it."

Cassie's phone buzzes. A message from a friend: *Where are you? Match starts in an hour. You better be on your way!*

She looks at the message, then at the two men sitting across from her.

"I should go," she says. "I need to catch my train."

"Of course." Finn stands. "Thanks for stopping by. And for remembering the old days."

Cassie gathers her things. At the door, she pauses.

"Do you regret it? Playing for Storm, being part of the rivalry?"

Finn considers this. "I regret what it took from me. The relationships I didn't build because I was too busy hating Silver. The years I spent feeding hatred instead of cultivating anything else. But I don't regret the sport itself. Just... what we let it become."

Cassie walks back to the train station in a daze.

---

The train arrives at 6:15.

She finds her seat and pulls out her phone. The match starts in forty-five minutes. Her friends are flooding the group chat with commentary, celebrations, outrage.

She should be there. Should be in Section 12, Row 8, Seat 14, screaming herself hoarse, united with fifty thousand other Storm fans in collective fury and joy.

Instead, she's on a train, thinking about two old men who used to hate each other running a café together in a town no one's heard of.

Her ticket is listed at face value, eight thousand credits. She changes the price to resale market value: thirty-two thousand credits.

She clicks submit.

The ticket sells in three seconds.

Thirty-two thousand credits deposit into her account. Someone out there wanted to go to this match badly enough to pay four times face value. Someone who will feed the machine she's been feeding her whole life.

Cassie stares at the confirmation message.

She doesn't feel good about selling it. Doesn't feel like she's made some noble choice or learned some profound lesson. She's still confused. Still angry at Omar for sending her away. Still caught between everything she believed about Storm and Silver and what Finn told her.

Cassie turns off her phone.

She looks out the window at the darkness rushing past. Small towns, scattered lights, the vast empty space between Dharavi and Lanka Prime.

It's quiet.

Feels nice.
