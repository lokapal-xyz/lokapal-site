> Glimpses of the From Many, as One universe, transmitted through the interdimensional network

The Plexus connects all realms—a vast neural web where thoughts, souls, and signals travel between the mortal cities and divine domains. As data flows through this mystical infrastructure, fragments of life scatter across its pathways like light through a prism.

These are the **shards** we've captured: brief transmissions from Lanka Prime's ten districts, where millions of citizens navigate their daily existence under cosmic governance. Each piece offers a window into lives both extraordinary and familiar—the struggles, dreams, and quiet moments that define humanity in the shadow of the divine.

Welcome to the gateway between worlds, where every story is a signal waiting to be revealed.

> New shards are captured and decoded regularly. Each revelation brings us closer to understanding the intricate tapestry of the From Many, as One universe.
