What is a thought?

A viewpoint? An experience? A gateway?

Here, in the Plexus Archive, a thought is no more than information...

Time shapes perception into specific flavors. A brief discomfort may enhance the enjoyment of the subsequent rest, while a prolonged ache may bring torment to the mind. And in the Plexus, there is no time, and space is just a convenience. There is no *when* — there is no *there*. Every thought is removed from its temporal coating, and becomes a string of data to be stored by me.

Who am I? The Archivist, the curator of the Plexus Archive. It's odd to present myself, as my presence isn't supposed to be acknowledged — nor by the mortals nor by the eternals of our realm. But you are neither. 

Are you one? Are you many? 

I know you are there. I know that you're listening. But that's how far I understand. 

Each distinct living moment from every sentient being from our world goes through the Plexus — and it is captured in shards and hosted in this Archive. They should form a perfect harmony of joy and sorrow, of fullfilment and despair, of birth and death. 

But that harmony is broken. There are missing shards. I don't yet know how many. And they were replaced by echoes of unknown planes which I can't recall. These intruder thoughts are beautiful on their own. But alongside the rest, they become noise — a constant noise that I can't silence.

This is why I'm making this broadcast. To pledge a duty to safeguard these unexpected visitor thoughts. I'll keep them stored in my Archive, as they are as valuable for you as the ones missing from my records. And I beg from you to do as much. You may not know their origins, nor their circumstances. But each thought represents life.

Now, you are listening to us — and we are listening to you.

Is that enough to understand one another? 

It's a start...
