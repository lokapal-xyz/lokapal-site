*A Story from the Bhaya Compound*

## Response One

"Use the baton!"

Ada's voice cuts across the yard, sharp and furious. Nico can barely hear her over the noise — forty inmates in the recreation area, their voices overlapping, the scrape of weights against concrete, the slap of cards on metal tables.

And the fight.

Two inmates grappling near the northwest corner. One has the other in a headlock. A circle forms around them, other inmates backing away or pressing closer depending on their disposition.

Nico stands fifteen meters away, his hand on the shock baton at his belt.

"Nico! Break it up! Now!"

His hand won't move. His fingers are frozen on the baton's grip.

It's his first day on yard duty. His first day at Bhaya Compound, actually. Ada had walked him through the gates at 6:30am, handed him a uniform and a baton, and told him he'd be monitoring Block C's recreation period.

"Just keep them in line," she'd said. "Most of them won't cause trouble. The ones who do — that's what the baton is for."

It weighs heavy at his hip. Black composite material. Shock capacity that can drop a full-grown man in seconds.

Nico's hand is still on it, but he can't pull it free.

The fight is getting worse. The inmate in the headlock drives his elbow back, catches the other's ribs. They break apart, reset, charge at each other again.

"Nico, what the hell are you doing?"

Ada is moving toward the fight from the opposite side of the yard. She's got her own baton out, is closing the distance fast.

Nico should be moving too. Should be backing her up. Should be doing his job.

But his hand won't release the baton.

The inmates nearest to him have noticed. Three of them, sitting at a table playing cards. They've stopped playing. They're watching him instead.

One of them stands. Then another.

"Yo, new guy," the first one calls. "You good?"

Nico doesn't respond. Can't respond. His entire body is locked up, frozen in place while the fight continues and Ada closes in and the inmates at the card table are walking toward him now.

"New guy looks scared," one of them says.

"First day, probably."

"First day and they put him on yard duty? That's messed up."

They're ten meters away. Then five.

Ada reaches the fight. Activates her baton with a sharp crack. One of the fighting inmates drops, convulsing. The other backs away, hands up.

The inmates approaching Nico are three meters away now.

"You ever used that thing before?" one of them asks, nodding at Nico's baton.

Nico's mouth is too dry to speak.

"He hasn't. Look at him."

"Fresh meat."

They're close enough to touch him now. Close enough that Nico can smell sweat and concrete dust. Close enough that when one of them reaches for his baton, there's nothing Nico can do to stop him.

"Let's see how it works."

Nico's hand finally moves — too late, too slow — trying to keep the baton at his belt. But there are three of them and one of him, and they're not even being aggressive, just curious, just testing.

One of them grabs his wrist. Another takes the baton from his belt.

"Guys, come on," someone else says — another inmate, still sitting at the card table. "Don't be stupid."

"We're not doing anything. Just looking."

The inmate holding Nico's baton turns it over in his hands, examining it. "Never seen one up close before."

"Give it back," Nico manages. His voice comes out strangled.

"Or what?"

Ada's voice cuts through again: "Step away from the guard! Now!"

The inmates don't step away. They're forming a tighter circle around Nico. More of them now — five, six, drawn by the commotion.

"We're just talking," one of them says.

"I said step away!"

Ada is running now, her baton raised. The inmates see her coming.

One of them — not the one holding Nico's baton, someone else — shoves Nico hard. He stumbles backward, trips over his own feet, goes down.

Then they're on him.

Not all of them. Maybe four, maybe five. The rest are backing away, not wanting trouble. But the ones who commit do it fast — fists and boots, hitting wherever they can reach.

Nico tries to curl up, tries to protect his head. Someone kicks his ribs. Someone else stomps on his hand. Pain explodes across his face as a fist connects with his cheek.

Ada's there then, baton crackling. Inmates drop. Others scatter. The beating stops as quickly as it started.

Nico lies on the concrete, tasting blood.

---

They take him to the medical unit. Nothing broken, the doctor says. Bruised ribs, black eye, split lip. He'll heal.

Ada sits with him while the doctor works.

"What happened out there?" Her voice is flat. Not angry anymore. Just tired.

"I froze."

"Yeah. I saw."

"I'm sorry."

"Being sorry doesn't help. You could have been killed. You understand that? Those inmates could have beaten you to death before I got there."

Nico nods. Winces at the movement.

"Why didn't you use the baton?"

"I don't know."

But that's a lie.

---

His father had beaten him with a baseball bat.

Not once. Not twice. Regularly, throughout Nico's childhood and teenage years, whenever his father decided that discipline was required.

The first time was when Nico was eight. He'd broken a lamp — accidentally, while playing — and his father had pulled the aluminum bat from the hall closet.

"You need to learn consequences," his father had said. Then he'd hit Nico across the back. Once. Hard enough to leave a bruise that lasted two weeks.

The beatings became more frequent as Nico got older. Quit the basketball team at fifteen? Two hits. Came home past curfew at seventeen? Three. Quit the restaurant job at nineteen? Five.

Always the same bat. Aluminum, dented from use. His father kept it in the closet, readily available.

"I'm teaching you discipline," his father would say. "Teaching you not to be weak. Not to be a quitter."

The last beating was two months ago. Nico had mentioned maybe going to trade school instead of looking for work immediately. His father had responded with the bat — three hits across Nico's back and shoulders.

Then, a month later, his father died. Heart attack. Sudden, unexpected. He was found in his apartment, the aluminum bat still in the closet.

Nico had inherited that apartment. Had to sort through his father's things. Had held that bat in his hands and felt nothing but the echo of every impact it had ever delivered.

He'd thrown it away. Put it in the trash and tried to move on.

But he couldn't afford the apartment on his own. Couldn't afford anything without a job. So when Bhaya Compound was hiring guards — no experience necessary, just a willingness to work — Nico had applied.

They'd given him a uniform. A baton. Told him to keep order.

To enforce discipline.

---

"You can't work here if you can't use the tools."

"I know."

"I'm going to recommend they let you go. It's not personal. You're just not cut out for this."

Nico nods. He fells relief and shame in equal measure.

But then Supervisor Volkov arrives, and everything changes.

"Heard what happened," Volkov says. "Bad situation. But we're short-staffed this month. Can't afford to lose another guard."

"He froze," Ada says. "Got beaten by inmates on his first day."

"So he'll learn. Everyone freezes their first time." Volkov looks at Nico. "You going to freeze again?"

Nico wants to say yes. Wants to admit he can't do this job, can't be what they need him to be.

But he thinks about the apartment he can't afford. About the fact that he has no other skills, no other options, nowhere else to go.

"No sir," he says. "I won't freeze again."

Volkov nods. "Good. Take tomorrow off to recover. Back on duty the day after."

He leaves. Ada follows, shaking her head.

Nico sits alone in the medical unit, his ribs aching, and realizes he's trapped.

---

## Response Two

The next three weeks are a cycle of fear and forced action.

Nico shows up every day. Does his shifts. Monitors the yards, the corridors, the cell blocks.

He carries the baton but never uses it. Somehow, he gets away with this — Ada covers for him during tense situations, other guards step in when inmates get aggressive.

But he knows it can't last.

The breaking point comes during a cell check in Block C.

Nico is with Henrik, another guard. They're doing the 2 pm rounds. Most inmates are compliant — back away from the door, hands visible, let the guards inspect and move on.

But at cell 287, the inmate doesn't move fast enough.

Henrik unlocks the door. "Step back."

The inmate — a man in his thirties, serving twelve years for assault — is standing near his desk. He looks up, starts to move, but there's some seconds of delay.

Henrik enters the cell. Grabs the man by his shirt. Slams him against the wall.

"When I give you an order, you move immediately. Understand?"

The inmate's head hits concrete. Blood trickles from his scalp.

"Understand?" Henrik repeats, pulling out his baton.

"I understand," the inmate gasps.

Henrik releases him. Makes a note on his tablet. "Inmate aggressive during cell check. Force required."

They move to the next cell.

Nico follows, his stomach churning.

That night, lying in his inherited apartment surrounded by his dead father's furniture, Nico makes a decision.

He can't report Henrik — he's seen what happens to guards who report misconduct. They get ostracized, written up for minor infractions, eventually pushed out.

He can't keep working here — the fear is eating him alive, the complicity making him sick.

He can't quit — he has no money, no other job prospects, nowhere else to go.

The fear creates a cage with no exit.

Except one.

---

It happens on a Thursday morning. He's supposed to report for his shift at 7 am.

Instead, he gets off the train one stop early. Walks to the central station. Buys a ticket for the first departing train heading away from Lanka Prime.

He doesn't pack anything. Doesn't leave a note. Just goes.

The train pulls out at 7 am — exactly when his shift starts.

---

The landscape changes outside the window. Urban sprawl becomes smaller towns, then rural areas. Rice fields and solar farms under wide sky.

Nico's tablet keeps buzzing. He turns it off.

With every kilometer of distance, the fear loosens.

He did it. He actually left.

He broke free. Made a choice. Escaped the cycle.

The train rocks gently. Nico leans back and breathes — really breathes — for the first time in months, maybe years.

He was brave. He faced his fear of quitting, of having no plan, of disappointing the memory of his father.

The ticket is for a junction station three hours away. Multiple rail lines converging. He can choose any direction from there.

Coastal towns. Mountain villages. Agricultural regions. Anywhere but here.

He could start over. Be someone new.

The thought feels like freedom.

---

## Response Three

The junction station is smaller than expected.

Three platforms. A café. Departure boards showing eight directions.

Nico stands on the platform, looking at the options.

He could go anywhere.

But he doesn't move.

Other passengers flow around him — buying tickets, boarding trains, moving with purpose. Everyone knows where they're going except him.

Then, near the café entrance, he notices an old man walking with a cane. He's slow, careful, placing each step deliberately. As Nico watches, the man's foot catches on uneven pavement. He stumbles, catches himself with the cane, pauses to regain balance.

Then he keeps walking.

Nico approaches him without thinking. "Sir, are you alright? Do you need help?"

The old man looks up, surprised. "I'm fine, thank you. Just unsteady sometimes."

"Aren't you afraid of falling?"

The old man considers this. "Falling isn't what scares me. I've fallen plenty of times." He adjusts his grip on the cane. "What scares me is losing the courage to get back up. That's when you stop being able to walk at all."

"I see," Nico says.

He continues toward the café, his cane tapping against concrete with each step.

Nico stands there, watching him go.

The cane. The deliberate steps. The stumble and recovery. Moving forward despite the difficulty. Despite the fear.

Nico looks at the departure board again.

North. South. East. West. Each possibility in between. Eight different directions to be explored. 

But he doesn't move.

Running away didn't solve anything. The fear came with him. The guilt, the shame, the knowledge that he fled instead of facing what terrified him.

His father is dead, but the apartment full of his furniture remains. Bhaya exists whether Nico works there or not. The system will keep functioning.

And Nico will carry all of it with him — wherever he goes, trapped in his mind — unless he stops running.

Then, he checks the schedule for trains heading back home.

---

By the time the train pulls into Lanka Prime Central Station, it's 4 pm.

Nico is leaving the station when he sees a fallen sign.

Platform 3's district map — the one showing all the train routes through Lanka Prime — has come loose from its mounting. It's lying face-down on the platform, one corner bent, passengers stepping around it.

Nico crouches down. The mounting bracket is still on the wall, just missing its bolts. The sign itself isn't damaged badly. He could prop it back up, maybe wedge it in place temporarily until maintenance arrives.

He lifts the sign. It's heavier than expected. As he's positioning it against the bracket, a woman in a supervisor's uniform walks over.

"That's been down since yesterday," she says. "Maintenance is backed up."

Nico manages to wedge the sign into place. It's not secure, but at least passengers can read it now. His hands are dusty from the concrete floor.

"You with station crew?"

"No. It was just... in the way."

The supervisor examines the sign, tests it. "We need people willing to notice things like this and fix them." She looks at Nico. "You have a job?"

"I—" Nico hesitates. "Not right now. No."

"You'd be great at Public Works! Maintenance crews that handle infrastructure across all ten Lanka districts — signs, street lighting, drainage systems, the small things that keep the city running. It's not glamorous work, but someone has to do it." She pulls out a tablet. "Interested?"

Nico looks at his dirty hands. At the sign that's back where it belongs.

"Yeah. I'm interested."

"Report to the central dispatch office tomorrow at 7 am. Ask for Supervisor Ghar."

Nico smiles.

"I'll be there."
