*A Story from the Ahamkara Plaza*

## Varsam 7E9, Dinam 02A

"Mr. Senator!" Elias called out, grinning as he jogged across the gleaming marble plaza to catch up with his friend.

Raul turned, and for a moment the weight seemed to lift from his shoulders. "Don't start with that," he said, but he was smiling too. "You've known me since we were twelve, Eli. I'm still Raul."

"For now," Elias teased, falling into step beside him. "Give it a month and you'll be demanding I call you 'The Honorable Senator Mehta' and bow three times before speaking."

They walked together through the Ahamkara Plaza's central corridor, a canyon of polished stone and holocrete that stretched toward the Senate building. Everything here was designed to make you feel small — the seventy-meter ceilings, the impossibly smooth surfaces that reflected your image back at you in fragmented perfection, the towering statues of past legislators frozen in poses of eternal significance.

Elias had always hated this place. Too clean. Too perfect. Too concerned with looking important rather than being useful.

But Raul belonged here now. Or at least, he was supposed to.

"I got the latest data from Ward 7," Elias said, pulling up his tablet. "The community centers are still operating at 60% capacity because of the budget shortfalls. If we can push the Local Infrastructure Support Act through in the first session, we could have funding allocated before the monsoon season hits."

Raul nodded, his eyes scanning the data. "The opposition will downplay its importance."

"Let them. The numbers are solid. These aren't luxury facilities. They're emergency shelters, medical clinics, food distribution points. The people in Matsarya Bazaar and Krodha Foundries need them." Elias glanced at his friend. "That's why you ran, right? To actually help people instead of just talking about it?"

"That's exactly why I ran." Raul stopped walking and turned to face him. In the harsh lighting of the Plaza, his face looked younger than his thirty-four years, still carrying some of that idealistic energy that had made him stand up at community meetings in Ward 7, demanding better for the people everyone else ignored.

Elias felt something warm in his chest. "And that's why I spent eighteen months running your campaign instead of taking any paying clients."

"I'm going to make it worth it." Raul checked his watch — an old mechanical one, not the holographic models most senators preferred. "I need to get to the preliminary session. They're reviewing the agenda for next week's debates. Come by my office next week. We'll grab lunch and go through the LISA proposal line by line."

"Your office," Elias repeated. "Still feels weird saying that."

"It feels weird having one." Raul clapped him on the shoulder. "See you soon, Eli."

Elias watched his friend disappear through the massive doors of the Senate building, past the security checkpoints and into the halls of power where decisions were made that affected millions of lives across Lanka Prime.

For the first time in years, he felt optimistic about what those decisions might be.

The office was bigger than Elias expected.

Not obscenely large — this was still junior senator territory, after all — but substantial. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Plaza's north gardens, a desk made from actual wood (imported, expensive), chairs that probably cost more than Elias's monthly rent. The walls were already decorated: a large portrait of Raul in his senatorial robes, certificates in parageometric frames, a holographic display showing real-time legislative data.

It looked like power. It even smelled like power — some subtle, expensive air filtration system that made everything feel cleaner than the world outside.

Raul sat behind the desk, stylus moving rapidly across a tablet as he annotated a document. He looked up when Elias entered, and his face brightened.

"Eli! Sorry, I'm drowning here." He gestured at the three other tablets arranged on his desk, each showing different legislative documents. "The Infrastructure Committee meeting ran long, and now I'm trying to prep for the Budget Reconciliation session this afternoon, and—" He shook his head. "It's chaos."

"I brought the updated LISA proposal," Elias said, holding up his tablet. "I added the cost-benefit analysis for Ward 7 and Ward 12, plus testimonials from the community center directors. It's strong, Raul. Really strong."

"Excellent." Raul glanced at his schedule display, and something in his expression shifted. "Ah, damn. I thought I had more time before the Budget session." He looked up at his assistant — a woman in her thirties named Priya who stood near the door with her own tablet. "Priya, can you take notes on what Mr. Ghar needs? I'll review everything tonight after the vote on the Transportation Appropriations bill."

Elias felt something sink in his chest. "Oh. Sure, I can just—"

"No, no, it's fine," Raul said quickly. "I want to hear about it, I just can't right now. Priya will get everything down, and I'll look at it as soon as I have a window. This is important, Eli. I promise."

Priya moved closer, tablet ready. "Whenever you're ready, Mr. Ghar."

"It's just Elias," he said automatically. Then, to Raul: "Are we still on for lunch? I thought we could go through—"

"Can we rain check?" Raul was already standing, gathering tablets. "I need to review the budget amendments before the session, and Senator Chawla wants to discuss coalition building for the infrastructure package. How about next week? I'll have my calendar open up after the Appropriations votes finish."

"Yeah. Next week."

After Raul left, Elias spent twenty minutes explaining the LISA proposal to Priya, who took notes with professional efficiency and asked intelligent questions about implementation timelines and fiscal responsibility ratings. She was good at her job.

But she wasn't Raul.

As Elias rode the elevator down from the Senate offices, he told himself that this was normal. That all new senators were overwhelmed in their first year. That Raul was still the same person, just busier.

The elevator's mirrored walls reflected his own face back at him, and he wasn't sure he believed it.

Priya met him in the reception area.

"Mr. Ghar," she said with a polite smile. "The Senator is in session today — the Judicial Oversight Committee hearings. They're running long, I'm afraid."

"I sent three messages last week," Elias said, trying to keep the frustration out of his voice. "I was told he'd have time today."

"Yes, I apologize for the confusion. The committee schedule shifted when Senator Rao requested additional testimony on the court appointments. The Senator wanted me to assure you that he's reviewed your materials on the Local Infrastructure Support Act."

*Your materials.* Not *our materials*. Not *the proposal we've been working on together*.

"And?" Elias asked.

"He thinks it's a strong proposal with significant merit," Priya said, her tone carefully neutral. "However, given the current political climate and the challenges with coalition building, he suggests waiting for a more favorable legislative window."

"A more favorable window." Elias repeated the words slowly. "We've been waiting for a favorable window for two years, Priya."

"I understand your frustration, Mr. Ghar. The Senator is committed to the legislation, but timing is crucial for—"

"Can I talk to him? Just five minutes?"

Priya's expression remained professionally sympathetic. "The committee hearings will likely run until evening, and then he has a dinner meeting with the Infrastructure Coalition leadership. I can schedule you for next week? The Senator should have some availability then."

"Next week. Right." Elias pulled up his own calendar, scrolling through the dates. "Just like last month."

"The Senator's schedule has been extremely demanding," Priya said, and for the first time, Elias heard something genuine in her voice — not defensiveness exactly, but a kind of weariness. "The committee assignments, the coalition negotiations, the constituency work. He's managing seventeen different legislative priorities right now."

"And LISA isn't one of them."

Priya didn't answer immediately. "The Senator cares deeply about the Local Infrastructure Support Act. But he also understands that passing legislation requires strategic timing and coalition support. He's working to build both."

Elias looked at her — really looked at her. She was good at this job because she believed in it. She believed in the process, in the careful steps and strategic timing and coalition building.

Maybe she was right to believe in it.

Or maybe the system had taught her to confuse process with progress.

"Tell the Senator—" Elias started, then stopped. "Tell Raul I stopped by."

"I will, Mr. Ghar."

As he walked back through the Plaza, past the towering statues and perfect surfaces, Elias realized that Priya had said "the Senator" six times during their conversation.

They didn't even let him in the building.

Elias stood at the security checkpoint, watching his credentials flash red on the scanner for the third time. The guard — a young woman with the bored efficiency of someone who'd denied entry to hundreds of people — barely looked at him.

"Sir, your clearance has been revoked. You'll need to contact Senate Administration if you believe this is an error."

"There has to be a mistake," Elias said, pulling up his message history. "I have a meeting scheduled with Senator Mehta. I've been here dozens of times."

"Your credentials show a security flag. I can't override it." She gestured to the side. "You'll need to step away from the checkpoint."

Elias moved aside, letting a stream of bureaucrats and staffers flow past him into the Plaza. He pulled up Senate Administration's contact info, but before he could call, he stopped.

A security flag. On him specifically.

He thought about the last few months — the increasingly pointed messages to Raul's office, the opinion piece he'd published in the Ward 7 community newsletter criticizing Senate inaction on infrastructure, the grassroots organizing meetings he'd been holding.

Nothing illegal. Nothing even particularly radical.

But enough to be inconvenient. Enough to be flagged as a "disruptive presence" by someone who had the access to make that designation.

Elias stared through the security gates at the gleaming interior of the Ahamkara Plaza — the towering ceilings, the perfect surfaces, the monuments to eternal significance. Somewhere in there, Raul sat in his corner office with his expensive desk and his growing staff.

Had Raul made the call himself? Or had he simply not objected when someone on his team suggested that Elias's access should be restricted? Had he nodded along, accepting the logic that old friends who asked uncomfortable questions were liabilities to be managed?

Elias probably would never know. And somehow, that uncertainty made it worse.

He pulled out his tablet and opened a new file.

*Local Infrastructure Support Act — Community Implementation.*

If Raul wasn't going to fight for LISA through the Senate, maybe it was time to find another way. Grassroots organizing, direct community action, pressure campaigns that didn't rely on legislators who'd forgotten why they'd wanted the seat in the first place.

It would take longer. It would be harder.

But at least he wouldn't have to look at himself in these damn mirrors and wonder when he'd stopped recognizing his own reflection.

He walked away from the Plaza, past the security perimeter, back toward the places where people still knew who they were.

Where they still called each other by name.
