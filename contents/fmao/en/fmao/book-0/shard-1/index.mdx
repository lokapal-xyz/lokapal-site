It's around ten o' clock. 

This train stinks, and today was a double-shift: a recycling gig near the Buddhi Hub this morning, followed by my usual assistant job at the Lobha Exchange. I'm exhausted and hungry, but it's a half-hour commute back to my house, so my stomach and back will have to wait.

Sometimes I envy my brother. He works at the Foundries on a fixed weekly schedule, and the pay is good. He's missing three bio-fingers, but the nano-implants were covered by the insurance. Funny enough, my boss at the Exchange is an investor in that company, and he always complains that the workers fake their injuries to resell the implants. 

Some do that, of course. I saw some discarded toes this morning while recycling. They were full of blood — no longer good for the Buddhi geeks. I recovered so little nano it wasn't even worth it. At least when I get back home I can light up one of the cigars I snatched from my boss's desk. Suck it, chump! That's for thinking all workers are scammers. My brother is the honest one in the family. 

That's the circle of life in Lanka Prime. From bones to steel — and then, to the trash... 

It's five past ten. I'm hungry.
