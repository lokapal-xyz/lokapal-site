They don't call it that, of course. In the Bhaya Compound, they call it "Voluntary Rehabilitation Assessment".

I've been sitting in this grey cube for six hours. The walls shift — I think they shift — displaying images that aren't quite there. My crimes scroll across a screen I can't see, written in a language that changes faster than I can read. The AI asks me questions in my dead mother's voice.

"Do you regret your actions?"

I stole food from a Matsarya warehouse. Three nutrition packs. My sister's kid was hungry. I knew the cameras would catch me, knew the sentencing algorithm would flag me as "economically uncooperative", but I did it anyway.

"Do you regret your actions?"

The walls pulse. I think I see my sister's face in the static, but it's probably just the fear-response stimulation. They're very good at that here — triggering the exact neural pathways that make you doubt your own memories, your own choices.

A guard told me, before they sealed the door, that prisoners here rarely get violent. Don't need to. By the time you leave the Compound, you're so afraid of your own shadow that the city itself becomes your prison. You'll police yourself for free.

"Do you regret your actions?"

My hands are shaking. The AI's algorithms are learning which questions make me shake the most.

I don't regret feeding my nephew. But I'm starting to forget why I thought it was worth it.

The walls shift again. I think I see my mother. I think I hear myself confessing.
