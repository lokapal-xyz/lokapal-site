*A Story from the Mada Heights*

---

My cursor passes over the submit button.

Three hundred and forty-seven pages. Six years of research. A complete reconceptualization of trauma response therapy in post-industrial populations. My doctoral thesis in Psychiatry, ready to be uploaded to the Mada Heights Academic Registry.

All I have to do is finish this form.

The offices around me are silent. It's 3 am, and even in Mada, where ambition runs permanently, most of the research towers are dark. Through my window, I can see the pristine architecture of the district: gleaming spires of glass and bioluminescent concrete, each building a monument to scientific discovery. Every surface here is designed to reflect excellence back at you — literally, in the case of the mirrored facades that line Sastri's Avenue.

Mada Heights doesn't tolerate mediocrity. The district was built on a simple principle: intelligence is the highest virtue, and those who possess it deserve to live in spaces that reflect their superiority. The residences here are allocated based on academic achievement. The better your research, the higher your floor, the better your view of everyone below you.

I'm currently on floor forty-seven of the Neuroscience Research Tower. Respectable for a doctoral candidate, but nothing compared to the triple-digit floors where the tenured professors live, where the air itself seems rarified by proximity to genius.

Dr. Tavar, my advisor, lives on floor 183.

She told me once, during a rare moment of candor, that she could see seven other districts from her balcony. That from that height, even Ahamkara Plaza looked small.

I wanted that view since childhood.

"Your thesis is brilliant," concluded Dr. Tavar. "The kind of research that could redefine a field."

The kind of research that could get me a postdoctoral position on floor ninety. Maybe higher, if the peer reviews are strong enough.

All I have to do is click "Submit".

But my cursor hovers.

Because my work wasn't done fully ethically.

---

I didn't falsify data. That's important to note. Every number in my thesis is accurate. Every result is reproducible. The science is sound.

It's just the methods that were... pragmatic.

Nothing of importance at first. Small compromises that everyone in the Heights makes.

The informed consent forms — I streamlined them. The original versions were forty pages of legal language that no one actually read. My subjects were from the Matsarya district, most of them struggling with basic literacy. So I created a one-page summary that hit the key points: participation is voluntary, some discomfort may occur, compensation provided.

I hated doing it.

I didn't mention the experimental drug protocols. That would have scared them off. The protocols were safe — tested in animal models, approved by three separate pharmaceutical companies. The fact that they weren't technically approved for human trials yet was a regulatory issue, not a safety issue.

Dr. Tavar agreed. "Ethics boards move too slowly," she said. "By the time they approve new treatments, the science has already moved on. We can't let bureaucracy hold back progress."

So I moved forward.

The drug trials went well. Eighty-seven percent reduction in trauma response symptoms after six weeks. Remarkable results. Publishable results.

There were side effects, of course. Headaches in thirty percent of subjects. Nausea in fifteen percent. One case of temporary memory disruption that resolved after two weeks.

All within acceptable parameters for experimental therapy. I documented everything carefully.

The subjects who dropped out — I didn't include them in the final analysis. Not because I was hiding negative results, but because incomplete data sets skew the statistics. Standard practice in clinical trials. If subjects don't complete the full protocol, their data isn't reliable.

I didn't follow up with them. Subject retention is always a challenge in research, especially with populations from the Bazaar who have chaotic lives and competing priorities. The ones who completed the study gave me the data I needed.

That should have been enough for the thesis.

But Dr. Tavar pushed me to expand the scope. "Good research is comprehensive," she said. "If you want to make a real impact, you need robust sample sizes. You need to show that your methods work across different populations."

So I recruited from the Foundries. The industrial workers there had even higher rates of trauma response — PTSD from workplace accidents, chronic stress from the conditions, anxiety about job security. Perfect subjects for demonstrating that my therapy worked across socioeconomic boundaries.

The recruitment was harder there. The workers were suspicious of academics from Mada, and rightfully so — previous studies had used them and given nothing back. I had to offer higher compensation. I had to make promises about the benefits they'd see.

I even brought one of my successful subjects from the Matsarya trial — a woman named Kira who'd responded exceptionally well to the treatment. She spoke at my recruitment sessions, described how the therapy had changed her life, how she could finally sleep through the night without nightmares.

I hated doing it. Coaching her on which aspects of her recovery to emphasize, timing her testimonial for maximum emotional impact on the potential subjects.

But it worked. I got forty-three subjects enrolled.

I told them the treatment was proven. That it was safe. That they'd experience significant improvement in their symptoms.

I didn't mention that the dosing would be higher for the Krodha cohort. That we were testing whether increased concentration would produce faster results. That this was, functionally, a separate experimental protocol.

The side effects were more pronounced. Severe headaches in forty-two percent. Nausea in thirty-eight percent. Memory disruption in twelve percent, some cases lasting longer than two weeks.

Three subjects developed tremors that persisted after the study ended.

I documented it all. I included notes about adjusting the dosing for future trials. I recommended additional monitoring protocols.

But the trauma response results were extraordinary. Dr. Tavar was ecstatic. "This is the kind of research that changes lives," she said.

Thirteen subjects from the Foundries dropped out before completing the protocol.

I didn't follow up with them. One patient — I believe I saw her name in a medical report that crossed my desk during a routine data review. She'd been admitted to a clinic with severe neurological complications. Seizures, I think. The report was unclear about the cause.

---

For the final phase, Dr. Tavar suggested I recruit from the juvenile detention facility in the Bhaya Compound. "Young subjects," she said. "Developing brains. If your therapy works on them, it proves the treatment can prevent long-term trauma pathology, not just treat existing symptoms."

The detention facility was eager to cooperate. They had limited resources for mental health services, and I offered free treatment for their most severe cases.

The subjects were between fourteen and seventeen years old. Most had experienced significant trauma — abuse, neglect, violence. Most had limited education and no family support.

They couldn't legally consent to experimental treatment.

But the detention facility had legal guardianship, and their administrators signed the consent forms. Everything was properly documented. Everything was legal, technically.

The dosing protocols for adolescents required adjustment. The pharmaceutical company data suggested the medications were safe for younger populations, though the trials had been limited.

The results were excellent. Eighty-nine percent reduction in trauma symptoms after five weeks.

Eleven subjects dropped out.

I didn't follow up with them, either. The detention facility has a policy against sharing information about juveniles after they left the system. Privacy concerns, they said.

Two of my subjects from the juvenile cohort died.

One was listed as natural causes — a seizure disorder that the facility's medical records showed had no prior history. The second was a suicide — a fifteen-year-old who hanged himself in his cell three weeks after completing my protocol. 

Oh! And there was the other kid...

A homicide victim — a sixteen-year-old trial subject who experienced severe memory disruption and paranoid episodes, who stabbed another inmate to death during what the incident report called a "psychotic break." The victim was fourteen, but she wasn't part of my study.

I noted both deaths in my thesis as "adverse outcomes potentially correlated with treatment protocol." I recommended that future research include comprehensive neurological screening and extended monitoring periods, particularly for juvenile populations.

I hated doing it. I hate doing any extra work, really. 

I hate doing one-page explainers for dummies, coaching sessions to persuade cowards, additional unnecessary paragraphs to mask some deaths into the research. It was unproductive work that pulled focus from the actual findings — the fact that my treatment showed remarkable efficacy across three distinct population groups.

Time I should have been using to draft journal articles, to network with potential postdoctoral supervisors, to keep my career trajectory moving upward.

So my work wasn't done ethically. Where is the option to specify that? Oh, here it is:

**Does your research have any ethical considerations?**

I click yes, then I click submit.

The upload progress bar appears: 0%... 15%... 47%... 89%... 100%.

**SUBMISSION SUCCESSFUL. YOUR THESIS HAS BEEN REGISTERED WITH MADA HEIGHTS ACADEMIC ARCHIVES.**

**PRELIMINARY REVIEW SCHEDULED FOR VARSAM 7DC, DINAM 05A.**

**DEFENSE DATE TO BE DETERMINED PENDING FACULTY COMMITTEE APPROVAL.**

I lean back in my chair and look outside, at the pristine towers climbing toward the sky, at the monuments to human intelligence that line every street.

I pull up my calendar and make a note to start shopping for the graduation ceremony.

I'll need a formal gown. Something that reflects the magnitude of what I've accomplished.

Something appropriate for someone ascending to the heights where brilliance lives.
