The cards are marked, but everyone pretends they aren't.

I'm a dealer at Ghrina Colosseum's underground betting hall, watching a Kama worker lose his third month's wages on a fixed game. The house always wins here, but that's not the real game. The real game is the hate.

See, the Colosseum feeds on it. Every lost bet, every rigged match, every moment someone realizes they've been cheated — it all funnels into the main arena upstairs, where they turn that rage into entertainment. The gladiators aren't fighting for glory. They're fighting because we paid for them to hate each other.

Another player slams his fist on the table. His knuckles are already augmented — probably spent his first earnings on combat mods, thinking he'd win it back in the pits. They never do. The mods just make the matches last longer. Changing the rules, bleed more — anything to sell better on the streaming channels.

I deal another hand. The cards whisper against the synthwood.

My husband asked me yesterday why I work here instead of the Plaza like his uncle. I told her it's closer to home. Didn't tell her that I'm just as trapped as these players, that every hand I deal feeds the same beast that's eating this city alive.

The worker goes all-in on a pair of threes.

I flip the river. House wins again. Always does.
