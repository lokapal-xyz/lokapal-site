*A Story from the Matsarya Bazaar*

The interrogation room smells like disinfectant.

I've been sitting here for three hours, hands cuffed to a metal table that's bolted to the floor. The chair is deliberately uncomfortable — plastic, designed to make you want to talk just so you can leave. Through the one-way mirror on the wall, I know someone or something is watching, cataloging every movement, every expression.

I keep my face neutral. I learned that working retail in the Matsarya Bazaar. How to smile at customers while hating them, how to maintain pleasant neutrality while your mind calculates a thousand petty resentments.

The door opens. A detective walks in — mid-forties, tired eyes, a suit that's been worn too many days in a row. He carries a tablet and a disposable cup of coffee that he sets on the table between us.

"Kael Osman," he says, settling into the chair across from me. "Twenty-six years old. Employed at the Platinum Electronics store on Pana Street for the past four years. Minimum wage plus commission. Clean record until now."

He pulls up something on his tablet, angles it so I can't quite see the screen.

"You want to tell me why someone with a stable job ends up involved in armed robbery?"

I don't answer. I've watched enough crime dramas to know that silence is safer than speech.

The detective doesn't seem bothered. He takes a sip of his coffee, grimaces at the taste, sets it down.

"Let me tell you what we know," he says. "Six months ago, you started associating with a crew operating out of the Bazaar's south sector. Petty stuff at first — shoplifting, pickpocketing, small-time scams. Then you graduated. Last week, jewelry store on the upper market level. High-end pieces, custom work, the kind of stuff that sells for serious money in the right channels."

He swipes his tablet, pulls up an image. Security camera footage — grainy but clear enough. A woman in her seventies behind a counter, her hands raised. Three figures in masks, one of them pointing a gun.

"Mrs. Kamala Desai," the detective says. "Seventy-three years old. Ran that jewelry store for forty-two years. When the alarm triggered, someone panicked."

He swipes again. The image changes — the same scene, but now the woman is falling, a spray of red against the wall behind her.

"Someone shot her," the detective says flatly. "Twice. She died before the ambulance arrived."

I keep my face neutral, but my stomach churns. I wasn't there for the trigger pull. I was outside, watching for patrol drones. But I heard the shots. I saw Dante run out, his mask pulled down, his eyes wild.

I knew then that everything had changed.

"We have you on camera," the detective continues. "Not inside the store, but outside. Lookout position. That makes you an accomplice to felony murder in the Matsarya jurisdiction. Mandatory minimum sentence is twenty-five years."

Twenty-five years. I'd be fifty-one when I got out. Middle-aged. Used up. Everything I'd worked for, acquired, planned for — gone.

The detective watches my face, reading the calculation.

"But," he says, leaning back in his chair, "we don't just want you. We want the whole crew. Names, locations, fences they use, operations they're planning. You give us that, and we can work something out."

"Like what?" My voice comes out rougher than I intended.

"Like retroactive informant status. Means you were working with us the whole time. Means no prosecution, no record, no twenty-five years. You walk out of here, go back to your life, keep everything you've earned."

*Keep everything I've earned.* The phrase hangs in the air between us.

I think about my apartment — small, but mine. The furniture I bought with money from the crew's jobs. The clothes in my closet, the tech on my shelves, the savings account that's finally starting to look like something real.

I think about going back to Platinum Electronics, selling phones to people who buy them without checking the price. People who walk in wearing watches that cost more than I make in six months. People who treat me like furniture, like a voice-activated shopping assistant, like someone who exists only to serve their needs.

"Why should I trust you?" I ask.

The detective shrugs. "You shouldn't. But you don't have a lot of options right now. We have enough evidence to put you away. The question is whether you're going to spend the next twenty-five years in the Bhaya Compound, or whether you're going to be smart about this."

He takes another sip of his terrible coffee, makes that same grimace.

"We are not so different — you and me," he mentions suddenly. "You know what I make? Detective, twelve years on the force, living in the same shithole apartment in the lower Bazaar that I've had since I graduated academy. You know what the Chief Inspector makes? Triple. Lives in the Moha's towers, probably has a view of the neogardens. And the District Administrator? Don't even get me started."

He leans forward, his voice dropping.

"I see it every day. The guys above me, making more, living better, getting promotions I deserved. I'm good at my job, Kael. Better than half the people who outrank me. But they went to better schools, had better connections, knew how to play the political games. So they get the offices with windows and I get the basement interrogation rooms."

He taps the table between us.

"So yeah, I understand. You work retail, watched rich people buy shit they didn't need with money they didn't earn. Made you realize the game is rigged. That playing by the rules just means staying poor while everyone else gets ahead."

I meet his eyes. He holds my gaze, and I see it there. The same hunger, the same resentment, the same acid burn of watching other people have what you want.

"The difference," he says, "is I found a way to work the system without ending up in cuffs. You didn't."

He pulls up a pen — leaves it on the table.

"Your... colleagues," the detective says, "they're not your friends. They're competition. Resources. The moment things go bad, they'll throw you under to save themselves. You think they care about you? Are they going to visit you in Bhaya for the next twenty-five years?"

He's right. I know he's right. The crew operates on utility, not loyalty. We're useful to each other as long as we're profitable. The moment I become a liability, I'm disposable.

But there's something else. Something harder to articulate.

We're from the same streets. The same markets. The same world where every day you see what you can't have.

Snitching on them feels like betraying the only people who understand that hunger.

"Let me make this simple," the detective says. He pulls a sheet of paper from under his tablet, slides it across the table. "You sign this agreement, you give us the information we need, and tomorrow you're back at work. Your apartment, your savings, your stuff — all yours. You keep climbing. Maybe you use the money you've saved to start something better. Get out of retail. Get ahead."

He smiles at me for a moment.

"Or you stay loyal to people who wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire, and you spend the next twenty-five years watching your life disappear behind bars while they're out there, still hustling, still getting theirs."

I look at the paper. An informant agreement. Witness protection provisions. Immunity clauses. A signature line at the bottom.

"What about Dante?" I ask. "The one who shot her?"

"He gets what he deserves. Murder one, no deals. The others — accessory charges, probably eight to twelve if they're lucky. You? You walk."

Eight to twelve years. Vera would be almost forty when she got out. Idris would lose his twenties entirely. Zara might never recover her life.

The detective watches me, patient. He's done this before.

I think about Mrs. Desai, falling behind her counter. I didn't pull the trigger. I didn't plan for anyone to get hurt. But I was there. I was part of it.

If I sign this paper, I'm saying that's okay. That my freedom, my stuff, my ability to keep pursuing the life I want is worth more than justice for an old woman who died because we wanted her jewelry.

But if I don't sign, I'm saying my loyalty to the crew is worth twenty-five years of my life. That's a different calculation.

The detective slides the pen across the table.

"Your call, Kael. But make it quick. I've got three other interrogations today, and the offer expires when I walk out that door."

I pick up the pen.

The weight of it feels significant, though it's just cheap plastic. The kind they give away at banks and government offices.

I think about my apartment. My savings. My future.

My life.

The pen touches the paper.

"Smart choice," he says, standing. "We'll need detailed statements, locations, patterns. Probably take most of the day. But after that, you're clear."

He moves toward the door, then pauses.

"One more thing. Your job at Platinum Electronics — you make minimum wage plus commission, right?"

"Yeah."

"How much commission you average per month?"

"Maybe three, four hundred. Depends on foot traffic."

He nods, considering. "Not bad. You keep working there, keep that income clean, no one needs to know about any of this. In a few years this is just a story about how you made the smart play when it mattered."

He opens the door.

"Welcome to the winning side of Matsarya, Kael."

He leaves. The door closes with a heavy mechanical click.
