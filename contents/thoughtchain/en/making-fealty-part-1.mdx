## Introduction

> The scariest moment is always just before you start.  
> — *Stephen King*

Welcome to the first edition of *Making Fealty*, a blog series focused on the creation process of the crypto novel Fealty, authored by lokapal.eth (Ricardo Pintos) and published on lokapal.xyz, as well as on other platforms such as Substack, Medium and Paragraph. In this series, we'll discuss the state of the project, its short-term goals, and its long-term vision. 

For starters, a crypto novel is either a story enhanced by blockchain technology, or a narrative that is so intertwined with its Web3 implementation to the point of becoming a mandatory component of it. In the case of Fealty, the latter option is the case, as its governance implementation is both an analogy for political drama and the vehicle to shape its progression.

Reading *Making Fealty* will not be required to follow the crypto novel, as it's more of a behind-the-scenes look at the project than an integral part of it. There will be no big story spoilers, and when discussing narrative excerpts is required for the analysis, there will be a clear spoiler warning for the reader.

## State of the project

The *Fealty* project is not published yet. All the preliminary work is already done, but we wanted to wait to build a large enough audience before its release. The official Whitepaper is finished and published on the main website.

- **[Link to the Fealty Whitepaper PDF file](https://www.lokapal.xyz/whitepapers/fealty-whitepaper.pdf)**

The project went through extensive revision before its current form. Not only for the novel content itself but also for its integration with the overall Lokapal project as well. To this date, the other main sections of Lokapal are:

- **HowToDAO**, an educational resource focused on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).
- **Thoughtchain**, the essays platform of Lokapal, which includes research articles, web3 highlights, educational tools, lore expansions, philosophical explorations, and Lokapal updates.
- **Conciliatorics**, a philosophical framework for thinking about systems — how they behave, how they change, and how we interact with them. 

Eventually, Fealty became Lokapal's flagship project because we believe that our best contribution is to bridge the gap between the broader community (both Web3 natives and the general public) and Web3's more specialized and grounded content. Fealty uses narrative as a gateway to the interconnection of Web3 governance, philosophy, and research — a gateway not only to HowToDAO, Thoughtchain or Conciliatorics but also to the amazing work that other writers are producing in the Web3 space.

But it doesn't matter if you build a train station to connect cities if no travelers gather on it. Before we fly, we must walk — and for that, we are going to need some groundwork.

## From the Plexus, a Micro-Story Series

As we mentioned before, our immediate goal at this stage is to build an audience that will follow the Fealty release and its serialized chapters. We considered different options to achieve this, concluding that the best way to engage potential readers for our story is to showcase its world and experiences. In addition to this, we needed to adapt to the current forms of content consumption, which is mostly based on short content that delivers by itself instead of demanding long-term commitment from the start.

For this reason, we are going to release in the following months a series of micro-stories that offer glances of the Fealty universe, focusing mainly on the experiences of the Lanka Prime citizens, and the districts of this mortal metropolis. The series is called *From the Plexus*, a direct reference to one of the Fealty planes of existence — the intermediate layer between the mortal and divine realm, a mystical route for thought, energy and metaphysical transit. 

As this is a no-place in our universe, we're only able to capture glimpses of these transmissions. For this reason, each micro-story will be labeled a *shard*, as we are mere hackers upon their universe — silent intruders on the lives of the Fealty inhabitants. The series format will be:

- **FROM THE PLEXUS**
  - **Shard 1:** *Lighting a cigar*

Individual shards will be published on social media platforms such as X, Instagram, Base, and Zora. When enough shards are released, they will be batched in container volumes and published on platforms such as Substack, Medium, Paragraph and Lokapal's main website.

- **FROM THE PLEXUS**
  - **Volume 1:** *Shard 1, Shard 2, Shard 3, Shard 4.*

## Final Thoughts

We hope that this format is competent enough to reach our goals for audience building. There are many challenges for a project like this, so we do not intend to abandon our roadmap until enough time passes without reaching results. But we are open to suggestions and revisions from anyone that wants to contribute to our vision.

- Feel free to reach out to us on any platform for comments and feedback. We'd love to hear your thoughts!

We are here for the long run — months were spent refining Fealty in order to build a strong enough foundation that could hold the project for years to come. 

We'll adapt — and we'll overcome.
