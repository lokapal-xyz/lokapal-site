## Introduction

> The scariest moment is always just before you start.  
> — *Stephen King*

Welcome to the first edition of *Making From Many, as One*, a blog series focused on the creation process of the web serial From Many, as One, authored by Ricardo Pintos (lokapal.eth) and published on lokapal.xyz, as well as on other platforms such as Substack, Medium and Paragraph. In this series, we'll discuss the state of the project, its short-term goals, and its long-term vision. 

Reading *Making From Many, as One* will not be required to follow the web serial, as it's more of a behind-the-scenes look at the project than an integral part of it. There will be no big story spoilers, and when discussing narrative excerpts is required for the analysis, there will be a clear spoiler warning for the reader.

## State of the project

The *From Many, as One* project is not published yet. All the preliminary work is already done, but we wanted to wait to build a large enough audience before its release. The official Whitepaper is finished and published on the main website.

- **[Link to the From Many, as One Whitepaper PDF file](https://www.lokapal.xyz/whitepapers/fmao-whitepaper.pdf)**

The project went through extensive revision before its current form. Not only for the narrative content itself but also for its integration with the overall Lokapal project as well. To this date, the other main sections of Lokapal are:

- **Thoughtchain**, the essays platform of Lokapal, which includes research articles, roadmaps, educational tools, lore expansions, philosophical explorations, and Lokapal updates.
- **Conciliatorics**, a philosophical framework for thinking about systems — how they behave, how they change, and how we interact with them. 

From Many, as One is Lokapal's flagship project, because it uses narrative as a gateway to the interconnection of governance, philosophy, and research on decentralization— a gateway not only to Thoughtchain or Conciliatorics but also to the amazing work that other builders and writers are producing, particularly in the Web3 space.

But it doesn't matter if you build a train station to connect cities if no travelers gather on it. Before we fly, we must walk — and for that, we are going to need some groundwork.

## From the Plexus, a Micro-Story Series

As we mentioned before, our immediate goal at this stage is to build an audience that will follow the From Many, as One release and its serialized chapters. We considered different options to achieve this, concluding that the best way to engage potential readers for our story is to showcase its world and experiences. In addition to this, we needed to adapt to the current forms of content consumption, which is mostly based on short content that delivers by itself instead of demanding long-term commitment from the start.

For this reason, we are going to release in the following months a series of micro-stories that offer glances of the From Many, as One universe, focusing mainly on the experiences of the Lanka Prime citizens, and the districts of this mortal metropolis. The series is called *From the Plexus*, a direct reference to one of the From Many, as One planes of existence — the intermediate layer between the mortal and divine realm, a mystical route for thought, energy and metaphysical transit. 

As this is a no-place in our universe, we're only able to capture glimpses of these transmissions. For this reason, each micro-story will be labeled a *shard*, as we are mere hackers upon their universe — silent intruders on the lives of the Lanka inhabitants. The series format will be:

- **FROM THE PLEXUS**
  - **Shard 1:** *Lighting a cigar*

Individual shards will be published on Lokapal's main website, Substack and social media platforms such as X and Base. When enough shards are released, they will be batched in container volumes and published on platforms such as Medium and Paragraph.

- **FROM THE PLEXUS**
  - **Volume 1:** *Shard 1, Shard 2, Shard 3, Shard 4.*

This distribution model serves multiple strategic objectives: audience development across both Web3 and traditional literature communities, content format optimization for platform-specific consumption patterns, and establishment of consistent publishing cadence prior to main narrative serialization.

## Final Thoughts

We hope that this format is competent enough to reach our goals for audience building. There are many challenges for a project like this, so we do not intend to abandon our roadmap until enough time passes without reaching results. But we are open to suggestions and revisions from anyone that wants to contribute to our vision.

- Feel free to reach out to us on any platform for comments and feedback. We'd love to hear your thoughts!

We are here for the long run — months were spent refining From Many, as One in order to build a strong enough foundation that could hold the project for years to come. 

We'll adapt — and we'll overcome.
